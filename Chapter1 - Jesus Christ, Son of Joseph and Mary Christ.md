# Chapter 1 - Jesus Christ, Son of Joseph and Mary Christ

In the first chapter we will list interesting questions regarding the origins and identity of Jesus Christ.

#### 1. One of the most ridiculed but still very interesting questions is could Jesus Christ actually be the son of Joseph and Mary Christ and not the Jewish Messiah.
Mixing up the term Christos and Messiah is so very deeply rooted in historiography of Jesus
almost everyone forgets that Christos is a Greek term for a royal figure and Messiah is a Jewish term for a prophesized apocalyptic figure
and the term Christos is almost exclusively used throughout the new testament whereas the term Messiah is used only a couple of times in encounters with Jewish figures.
As such the term Messiah seems to only be used to convince specific jewish people that Jesus Christos is also a Jewish Messiah and not only the Greek Christos.

#### 2. With that said could Jesus have become a Christos because he had a royal lineage through his mother Mary Christ.
The lineage of Jesus is described in the gospels of Matthew and Luke, and with the Luke gospel traditionally linking the lineage of Jesus through his mother Mary.
From that alone we know that both Mary and Joseph were also considered to be of royal lineage.
This topic has been very deeply discussed by James Tabor in his book "The Jesus Dynasty", and for an even longer expanded list of arguments and more more in depth discussion as to why Jesus descended from the Hasmonean dynasty, please refer to the book.

#### 3. Jesus's mother was Mary Christ, the last rightful heiress to the Hasmonean dynasty.
Marry's life was described in the Protoevangelium of James, which was was considered a very reliable source by the early church fathers.
Details of the Protoevangelium of James were also confirmed by the Jewish philosopher Celsus, who lived in the 2nd century AD, and was a very prominent critic of Christianity.
The protoevangelium of James lists the father of Mary as Joachim with is in agreement with the gospel of Luke, which lists the father of Mary as Heli, a short form of Eliakim, which the same name as Joachim.
Describing Mary as a perpetual virgin and the conception of Jesus as as immaculate, is in agreement with the sources on Greek princesses.
Making her a Christ, the rightful ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty would explain why there her story was recorded in this scribal biographical fashion.
Mary's brother was Simon, who was the high priest of the temple in Jerusalem, and was killed by Herod the Great in 23 BC.
Mary's birth name was Miriam, which was a very common name in the Hasmonean dynasty.
Mary's birth place was Sepphoris.
In 104 BC Alexander Jannaeus of the Hasmonean dynasty conquered Sepphoris and made it his capital.
Jannaeus is a very rare name and also mentioned in the lineage of Mary in the Luke gospel.

#### 4. Joseph was Mary's second husband and a widower, as Pantera was killed by Herod the Great soon after Jesus was conceived.
Celsus, a very well educated prominent philosopher, who used the name Panthera as one of the main arguments against the divinity of Jesus, must have had a very solid source to make such a claim, otherwise, it would carry absolutely no impact.
Shabbat 104b & Tosefta Hullin 2:22 – Contains indirect references to Jesus and Mary (Miriam), implying she was accused of adultery.

#### 5. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the city of the Hasmonean dynasty and the birthplace of the Christs.
#### 6. Antipater had been designated as Herod's successor, but his ambition and the growing animosity between him and his father led to his downfall.
As a result Joseph and Mary fled to Egypt, where they lived for several years.

#### 7. After Herod's death, Joseph and Mary returned to Galilee to the city of Nazareth, where on the hill of Sepphoris stood the palace of Herod Antipas.

#### 8. The court official titles, Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar derive from ancient Persian translations and would have been exceedingly hard to fabricate by even the most knowledgeable of scholars in the Roman empire that were not greek empire loyalists.
Sanhedrin 67a – Mentions a figure called Ben Stada, who was accused of sorcery and brought from Egypt. Some later traditions tried to connect this figure to Jesus, but the identification is debated.

#### 8. As Jesus grew up, he was heavily involved in the reconstruction of Nazareth and the surrounding areas which was destroyed by the Roman army.
Hence the gospels call him tecton, which was misleadingly later translated as carpenter.

#### 9. As with his royal lineage Jesus was also exposed to a variety of scripture and was highly educated.
The later connections of Jesus parables to many thoughts and principles of the Greek philosophers, especially the stoics, must imply Jesus was highly educated in the Greek way of life.

#### 10. Jesus was very close to and heavily influenced by his cousin John the Baptist, who christened Jesus and declared him a Christ, the rightful ruler of a Greek kingdom.
John mentions that he was not worthy to untie the sandals of Jesus, which was a common Greek expression for a disciple.
The gospel of John also mentions that Jesus was the lamb of God

#### 11. John was known to be in close contact with the religious movements in the desert and learned from them extensively.
“I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said.”

#### 12. Under the influence of his mother Mary, Jesus was still a believer in the Greek way of life and always taught others the teachings of the Greek philosophers.
The philosopher king was a very common concept in the Greek world, and Jesus was educated to become a true philosopher king.
He learned from the stoics, the cynics, and the epicureans, and his teachings were heavily influenced by them.
Do onto others as you would have them do onto you, is a very common stoic principle.

#### 13. He opposed the covenant of old testament and the preachings of the pharisees and the sadducees.
Jesus said pharisees were very hypocritical.

#### 14. He saw these groups and the Jews as taking what was rightfully his, the kindom of Judea.
He got very angry and overturned the tables of the money changers in the temple.
