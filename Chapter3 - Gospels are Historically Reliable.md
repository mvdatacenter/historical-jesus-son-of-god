# Chapter 3 - The Early Dating of Gospels

Acknowledging Jesus as the rightful Christos and his companions as highly powerful and educated people can completely change the way we view the gospels.
Most notably in this framework all arguments for early gospels become much more plausible and the arguments for late dating lose almost all of their plausibility.

## John Gospel

#### 1. The Gospel of John is widely accepted to be one gospel that indicates it was written by an eyewitness.
The gospel itself claims to be written by the disciple whom Jesus loved, which is widely accepted to be John,
#### 2. ὁ μαθητὴς ὃν ἠγάπα ὁ Ἰησοῦς
. Notably this is a disciple not an apostle, which would indicate that the gospel was written by a disciple of Jesus, but not one of the twelve apostles.
#### 3. Γύναι, ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱός σου
Notably a child of ambiguous gender and not specifically a son, so it is possibly Mary Magdalene, so some scholars argue.

#### 4. When the authors of the apocryphal gospel of Mary or other early texts try to argue who the beloved disciple is, they argue that it is Mary Magdalene rather then Peter.
No source says it was Mary Magdalene over John, which is what the sources would say the the prevalent view was that John was the most beloved one.

#### 5. Finally a woman writer would have been very likely to describe themselves based on the feelings towards towards others, not many male authors write like this.
She says Jesus loved Lazarus, not in a romantic way, but in a way a female writer would describe close friendship. Jesus is weeping, which is a thing a female would write about Jesus, not a true man.

#### 6. Jesus interactions towards Nicodemus are also very feminine, close and personal, Jesus is talking about being born again.
This very likely is not necessarily suggesting Jesus had some homosexual tendencies, but rather that the author of the gospel had some romantic feelings towards Jesus.

#### 7. The Samaritan Woman (John 4:1-42) – An Intimate Encounter at the Well
Jesus meets her alone at a well, a setting often symbolizing romantic or covenant relationships in the Old Testament (e.g., Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Rachel).
The conversation is deeply personal because Jesus reveals he knows her past (five husbands) yet does not condemn her.
He gradually leads her to recognize him as the Messiah, and she becomes a key figure in spreading his message.
The emotional shift—from skepticism to joy—makes this one of the most transformative personal encounters in the Gospels.

#### 8. The detailed description of the passion seems to add credibility to the claim that the gospel was written by an eyewitness, or at least someone portraying themselves as an eyewitness.
The gospels seem to indicate the apostles fled and for a good reason, as they were likely rightfully scared to be accused of supporting Jesus in his alleged crime against the Roman state.
It is far more likely though women would have been allowed to stay and not prosecuted by the Romans, who were from a far more patriarchal society and would be very unlikely to conceive of a woman being a serious threat to the state.

#### 9. Mary Magdalene (John 20:11-18) – A Moment of Pure Devotion
Mary is weeping alone at the empty tomb, showing deep grief.
Jesus appears but she doesn’t recognize him at first, thinking he’s the gardener.
The moment becomes deeply personal when Jesus simply says her name, "Mary", and she immediately recognizes him.
She calls him ῥαββωνί (Teacher), showing a deeply personal bond.
He then entrusts her with the first announcement of the Resurrection, making her the first witness of Easter.

If you know one thing about girls is that they have a thing for teachers.
The teacher makes her special by entrusting her with the first announcement of the resurrection.

#### 10. The Bridegroom Motif
John the Baptist calls Jesus the bridegroom (John 3:29).
The first miracle is at a wedding (John 2), which is unusual as an opening scene for a Gospel.
The idea of Jesus as a bridegroom has strong symbolic meaning in Jewish and early Christian traditions, sometimes linking to the idea of a divine marriage (God and Israel, Christ and the Church).
Some Gnostic and esoteric traditions later emphasized Mary Magdalene’s connection to Jesus, seeing her as part of this bridal imagery.

Please genuinely check how many male writers like to fantasize about weddings and marriage.

#### 11. The anointing of Jesus by a woman with expensive perfume (John 12:3, Mark 14:3-9)
Please genuinely check how many male writers like to provide details on the perfume selection.

#### 12. Note the women traveling with Jesus and the disciples are also linked to the royal family of Herod.
"The Twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means."
Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna are specifically named as financial supporters.
Joanna was connected to Herod’s court, meaning she had access to wealth and influence.
The phrase “out of their own means” implies they personally funded Jesus’ ministry.
Note, much like Sepphoris, Migdala is also within the some township as Nazareth.
If Mary Magdalene was also highly positioned in the Herod's court, then it would make sense that she would have been a skilled writer, yet perhaps not as skilled as the most prominent classics.
This explains the very deep knowledge of royal greek cult, while still maintaining some lack of literary sophistication.

#### 13. The authorship of Mary is typically dismissed as a possibility because of the use of male pronouns in the gospel.
This is just skill issues of the scholars.
A fully female woman calling herself a beloved disciple would still use male grammatical forms.
This is because the pronoun is determined by the gender of the word μαθητής ("disciple"), and even if a female version of the μαθήτρια exists, the woman would still typically choose to use the default gender of the word if she does not want to emphasize her gender.
And if that is the case the grammatical forms all over the gospel would still be male, even though they are completely talking about a female person.
This is not just a very obscure feature of the ancient greek language, but also the right way to speak in many modern languages like Polish.
For example in Polish, one would always say "Jan Ewangelista był kobietą", John the evangelist was (male) a woman and not "Jan Ewangelista była kobietą" John the evangelist was (female) a woman.

#### 14. The Beloved Disciple is thought to have played an important role in the early Christian community.
Some scholars argue that John, as a male apostle, would have had more influence in the early church, and thus, it seems unlikely that a woman like Mary Magdalene would have been the one to write or serve as a central figure.
The early church's view of Mary Magdalene is much more complex than sometimes assumed.
Though she was initially marginalized, she held an important role in early Christian traditions.
The Gospel of Mary, a non-canonical text, suggests that Mary Magdalene had an influential role, potentially even as a leader among the disciples.
Furthermore, early Christian communities were not as rigid in terms of gender roles as sometimes portrayed, and there is evidence that women held significant positions in the early church (e.g., Priscilla, Phoebe, Thecla).

#### 15. The Gospel of John emphasizes the Jesus was the only begotten son of God.
Unique Relationship with God: Jesus is depicted as having a unique and intimate relationship with God the Father, one that is unlike any other. In John 1:14, 18, and 3:16, Jesus is referred to as the “only begotten Son” (Greek: μονογενής, monogenēs).
This term emphasizes the uniqueness of Jesus as the Son, as no other figure shares this same divine sonship.

#### 16. Here there is a very interesting perspective linking the gnostic gospel of Thomas with John:
"Jesus said, 'If they say to you, ‘Where did you come from?’ say to them, ‘We came from the light, the place where the light came into being by itself, established itself and became manifest through their image.’ If they say to you, ‘Who are you?’ say, ‘We are its children, and we are the elect of the living Father.’’"
There are a few places where Thomas seems to indicate "we" are all children of God.
The uniqueness of the sonship seems to be very heavily emphasized in John to the point where it almost seems to become the core concept of the gospel.
Interestingly simultaneously John is making Thomas into the non-conformist and disbeliever.
ch 11. All the disciples are afraid to go to Jerusalem, but Thomas says, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."
ch 14. Jesus mentioning he will go to his father. Thomas doubts. Then Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." You can only come to the father through the only begotten son.
ch 20. Thomas recognizes. You are my Lord and my God.
This shows Thomas despite being Jesus brother or twin, likely holding a meaningful claim himself, John may try to emphasize Thomas could have contested Jesus at first, but then recognized him as the only rightful heir.

14 John 12:31 (NIV):
Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince (archon) of this world will be driven out."
In this verse, "archon" refers to Rome or the prince of this world.
It signifies authority and power over the world, but it's used in a negative sense to describe the ruler of evil.

#### 17. Temple destruction is typically used as a marker for the dating of the gospels.
This argument is usually applied to the synoptic gospels, but needs a bit of a different treatment for John.
One note though that in case of John "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."
Unlike in Olivet discourse, the identity  and the prophecy of the destruction of the particular temple in Jerusalem in 70AD is much more questionable.
And that if we do not overemphasize the Mosaic beliefs of the gospel of John, then the temple could be one of the many many many other temples destroyed, not necessarily the main temple in Jerusalem.
Note that the temple in Jerusalem was already destroyed by the Babylonians and then rebuilt and already sieged by romans in 63BC.
 It must not have been a very big stretch it could be destroyed again.
Note that Sepphoris was also destroyed by the Roman army during the life of Jesus, and Jesus was heavily involved in the reconstruction of Sepphoris.

#### 18. The females of the greek period were very empowered but not in roman and jewish culture.
True—there were multiple female rulers in both the Ptolemaic dynasty and the Hasmonean kingdom. The Ptolemies had several Cleopatras, Berenices, and Arsinoës ruling independently or as co-rulers. Even in the Hasmonean period, Salome Alexandra (76–67 BCE) ruled as queen and was one of the most powerful figures of her time.
This definitely weakens the argument that a woman couldn't have written John just because of gender. If elite women in those circles had power, wealth, and influence, then a female gospel author (like Mary Magdalene or another court-connected woman) wouldn’t be impossible.
In John 11:27, Martha says:
"ναί, κύριε· ἐγὼ πεπίστευκα ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἐρχόμενος."
She uses "Χριστός" (Christos), not "Μεσσίας" (Messias).
This is significant because John does use "Μεσσίας" in other places (John 1:41 and John 4:25), but here, Martha is speaking in Greek terminology. This aligns with John’s overall Greek imperial framework, rather than a purely Jewish messianic expectation.

John never uses Μεσσίας (Messias) alone—he immediately translates it as Χριστός, meaning his audience wouldn't naturally recognize "Messiah" as a meaningful title.
John 1:41 – "He first finds his own brother Simon and says to him, ‘We have found the Messias’ (which is translated Christos)." (εὑρήκαμεν τὸν Μεσσίαν, ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον Χριστός).
John 4:25 – "The woman said to him, ‘I know that Messias is coming’ (who is called Christos)." (Οἶδα ὅτι Μεσσίας ἔρχεται, ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστός).
Both times, it appears in direct speech, meaning these are Jewish characters (Andrew and the Samaritan woman) using a Jewish term, not the narrator or author.
This is the case where the greeks tried to convince the Jews to accept Jesus as their rightful ruler as well to additionally bolster his claim and gather more support.

Nathanael’s declaration: "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"
This means Nathanael is recognizing that Jesus, who is acknowledged as Christos (a Greek royal title), is not only the ruler of the Greek world (Christos) but also the king of the Jews, in a more localized context. The title "King of Israel" acknowledges the Jewish concept of kingship, which would have been understood as a ruler over Israel, distinct from the broader Greek context of kingship.
Andrew’s declaration to Simon: "We have found the Messiah."
Andrew is indicating that Jesus, who is referred to as Christos (the Greek royal title), is not just the Greek king (Christos) but also the Messiah, a title that resonates specifically with Jewish expectations of a king. He’s telling Simon that Jesus fulfills both roles—the Greek Christos and the Jewish Messiah—and both Jewish and Greek audiences should recognize him as the ruler of both realms.

#### 19. In that time, kings and emperors were often called divine, not necessarily because people believed they were literal gods, but because divinity was part of royal language and legitimacy.
For Mary Magdalene, calling Jesus her "God" wouldn’t necessarily mean she thought he was some abstract deity but rather that he was her true, anointed ruler—her Christos—just as emperors were called divine. She saw him as the rightful king, the one destined to rule, and her personal devotion to him would naturally be expressed in the highest possible terms.
So, when she calls him "Lord" or when Thomas says "My Lord and my God" in John, it could reflect the same kind of royal language used for emperors—deep respect, loyalty, and recognition of his ultimate authority—rather than a fully developed theological doctrine of divinity.

#### 20. Watching him die would have been unbearable.
 She had placed all her faith, love, and devotion in him—not just as a ruler, but as the center of her world. When the Romans crucified him, it wasn’t just the death of a man; it was the destruction of everything she believed in.
Grief can do powerful things to the mind.
Faced with such a loss, she might have experienced visions, dreams, or an overwhelming sense that he couldn’t really be gone.
The idea that he had risen wouldn’t have started as a theological claim—it would have been a desperate, emotional response to the unbearable pain of losing him.
In that moment, she wasn’t just an eyewitness; she was the one who couldn’t let go.

#### 21. The resurrection story in John isn’t just a theological claim—it’s a deeply personal, emotional experience that reflects the profound impact Jesus had on her life.
This explains why the resurrection account in John is so intimate and personal, focusing on Mary’s grief, confusion, and joy.
This explains why it is only Mary who sees Jesus first, and why she doesn’t recognize him at first—her vision is clouded by tears and despair.

## Synoptic Gospels

#### 1. The main argument for the dating of the synoptic gospels to after year 70AD is the destruction of the temple by the Romans.

#### 2. Most scholars argue the Olivet Discourse in the synoptic gospels is a prophecy of the destruction of the temple.

#### 3. At the same time the textual analysis of Mark shows that these verses were added later.
which is strikingly more formal and technical than the surrounding Markan language.
In the rest of the Gospel, Mark tends to favor more direct and accessible expressions of Jesus’ teachings and prophecies, often focusing on clear, vivid imagery.
The “abomination of desolation” is a very specific, technical term that feels more aligned with prophetic, liturgical, or later theological writing.
This suggests it could be an editorial addition, introduced to reflect later theological concerns (like the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE) or to align the passage with more familiar Old Testament imagery.

#### 4. But in those days, after that tribulation...” (Mark 13:24)
The phrase “after that tribulation” introduces a more formal, structured apocalyptic expression that contrasts with the more immediate and direct tone of earlier sections in Mark.
Mark’s Gospel typically uses simple, conversational language, but this phrase carries a more stylized apocalyptic tone, characteristic of later prophetic writings.
It introduces a period of cosmic upheaval, which is a prominent feature of later apocalyptic literature (including the Book of Revelation and some Jewish apocalyptic texts), but less common in the earlier parts of the Gospel.

#### 5. “When you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be” (Mark 13:14)
Language Issue: This passage contains complex terminology like “desolating sacrilege” and the phrase “set up where it ought not to be”.
While the “abomination of desolation” in earlier prophecies is a well-established term, this variation feels more convoluted and distant from the language of Mark's usual teachings.
It introduces an additional layer of complexity that seems more fitting to later apocalyptic writers, who used this terminology to indicate ritualistic desecration in a manner distinct from Mark’s usual straightforward style.

#### 6. “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away” (Mark 13:31)

Language Issue: The eternal nature of Jesus' words is a theme more common in Johannine literature (John 1:1, 6:68, 14:23).
While Mark presents Jesus as authoritative, this statement emphasizes a long-lasting theological development that might be at odds with Mark’s more human-centric portrayal of Jesus.
This phrase might also echo themes found in later Christian writings that focus on the eternal validity of Jesus’ teachings in a way that is somewhat different from the earthly mission Mark emphasizes.

#### 7. “But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father” (Mark 13:32)
Language Issue: The emphasis on the ignorance of the Son regarding the coming of the Kingdom contrasts with the high Christology that develops in later texts like John, where Jesus has full knowledge and authority.
While it is possible that this reflects Mark’s emphasis on Jesus’ humanity, the way the phrase is worded feels slightly out of sync with the rest of the Gospel, where Jesus is shown to have a strong authority over time and knowledge of God’s plans.
The focus on ignorance is strikingly different from the confident tone found in later Christian reflections on Jesus.

#### 8. “Let the reader understand” (Mark 13:14)
This phrase alone is already an indication of an insert. This is a phrase a later scribe would typically use to clarify a point or to provide additional context for a passage that might be unclear to the reader.

#### 9. Now the question is, if Mark 13 and Mark 16 were added to the gospel known to us, then when would the edits have been made?
Well, likely it was quite soon after the event when the event was still fresh in the minds of the people.
As so many events relevant to global politics, Jewish and Christian history happened at the time, the edits were done say decades later, likely different events would have been on top of the minds of the editors to make the edits.
Based on this alone, we could put the upper end for the dating of the original manuscript of Mark to before 70AD.

#### 10. The other arguments for the lower bound of the dating of the gospels focus on the need to develop the theology of the early church.
In the context of Jesus being an heir to the greek empire, the gospel of Mark would not require any development of the theology as it is a historical account of the final downfall of the greek empire.
The theological part of it would be the resurrection of Jesus, which was not present in the original gospel of Mark.
As such there is little reason to expect much time to pass between the historical events and the writing of the gospel of Mark.

#### 11 The gospel of Mark starts with the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist.
The baptism of Jesus is a very important event in the gospels, as it is the event that marks the beginning of Jesus' reign as the rightful king of the greek empire.
Courtly scribes often start at the beginning of the reign of the king, and the baptism of Jesus is likely the event that would have been considered the beginning of his reign.
Traditional scholarship does not provide a good explanation for why the story of Jesus would start with the baptism by John the Baptist, but in the context of Jesus being the rightful heir to the greek empire, it makes perfect sense.
The story of baptism is also portrayed as a very public event, which would have been a very important event for the people to know about.
In all four Gospels, during Jesus' baptism, a voice from heaven declares: "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased" (Matthew 3:17, Mark 1:11, Luke 3:22, John 1:34).
This is significant because, in ancient Jewish and Hellenistic traditions, the declaration of someone as a "son of God" often had royal connotations, signifying divine legitimacy or appointment to a kingship.
The title "Son of God" was used for kings in the Hebrew scriptures (e.g., 2 Samuel 7:14) and in Hellenistic traditions for emperors and rulers.

In the context of ancient Jewish and Hellenistic practices, the act of baptism, particularly with water, was used in various rites of initiation or purification.
However, in the case of Jesus, the combination of the heavenly voice, the dove, and the symbolic actions surrounding the baptism could be seen as a formal coronation—especially given the royal language and imagery associated with it.

#### 12. Royal Psalms:
The Psalms contain numerous references to the king being God's anointed (e.g., Psalm 2:7, Psalm 45:7), and the baptism scene echoes these royal motifs. By identifying Jesus as the Son of God and anointing him with the Spirit, the Gospel writers could be alluding to these royal traditions, suggesting a coronation-like event rather than merely a religious cleansing.

#### 13 The dove descending on Jesus at his baptism is a symbol of divine approval and empowerment.
The Dove as a Divine Symbol: In Greek and Hellenistic cultures, the dove was often associated with various divine manifestations, particularly linked to gods like Zeus and Apollo. A dove descending from heaven was a common symbol of divine approval or empowerment, as in the case of Zeus transforming into a dove in some myths. In Hellenistic royal ideology, the idea of divine signs, such as a dove appearing at the moment of a king's or leader's coronation, was not unusual.
Dove and the "Anointing" of Rulers: Greek rulers and Roman emperors were often seen as divinely chosen, and symbols of divine approval—such as a dove—would serve to emphasize this idea. The use of a dove in the baptism of Jesus could be interpreted as a sign that Jesus is divinely anointed for kingship, in line with how Hellenistic rulers were often anointed by the gods.

10.3 A very interesting but little known fact is that there exists a common early variant of Luke saying "You are my Son, today I have begotten you."
This is a very important variant as it is a direct reference to jesus actually becoming the king or the son of God at the baptism.
Much like the references to temple destruction and additional resurrection stories this variant was likely erased from the gospel of Luke when the understanding changed from more political to a religious one.

####  14. The gospel of Matthew is includes the details of the birth of Jesus with the visit of the Magi.
The visit of the Magi has been universally accepted as as allegory but as mentioned in the previous chapter, the titles of the Magi are exceedingly hard to fabricate by even the most knowledgeable of scholars in the Roman empire that were not greek empire loyalists.
The Herod's massacre of the innocents is also universally accepted as allegory, but as outlined in the Jesus Dynasty, the massacre of the innocents likely refers to Herod's killing of multiple of his own children and their families.
In the context that Joseph was likely too of the Hasmonean family, giving birth in the city of the Hasmonean dynasty, Bethlehem, is again a lot more likely to be a real event than an allegory.
Similarly the flight to Egypt is likely a real event as a noble family would have had more than enough resources to flee to and be welcomed in Egypt for a few years.

#### 15. Finally the gospel of Matthew includes the great commission, which is likely an edit to the original gospel of Mark.
πορευθέντες οὖν μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη
Make disciples of all nations – Spread the teachings of Jesus to people all over the world. Here the word "nations" is a translation of the Greek word "ethne," which can also be translated as "Gentiles" or "non
Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit – Initiate them into the faith through baptism.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you – Continue teaching and guiding new believers to follow Jesus' teachings.
Jesus promises his presence – "And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
The great commission is essentially what the emissaries of the greek empire would have been doing, spreading the decrees of the king across the empire.

#### 16. The term ἔθνη is typically translated as "nations" but can also be translated as "Gentiles" or "non-Jews."
In the context of the greek empire, the term would have been used to refer to all the greek people across the empire, all the nations, kingdoms or tribes that were part of the greek empire.

#### 17. The gospel of Matthew also includes the genealogy of Jesus, which is widely accepted as not-genuine or lost to history.
However, with the acceptance of the theory that Jesus was the grandson of Herod the Great, the genealogy of Jesus through Joseph as his adopted father would requires a more thorough examination.
One notable figure from this lineage are Zerubbabel, who was a governor of the Persian province of Yehud, and can be dated to around 520BC.
Making best guess estimates to the years of the other figures in the genealogy, the Eleazar fits very well with son Eleazar of Onias I, who was the high priest of the temple in Jerusalem.
From these we can fairly obviously link Matthan to Mattathias Hasmonean, Father of Judas Maccabee, leader of Maccabean Revolt.

|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Zerubbabel| Zerubbabel                   | ~520 BC                 | Governor under Persian rule                      |
| Abiud     | Unknown                      | ~480 BC                 | Persian period                                    |
| Eliakim   | Unknown                      | ~440 BC                 | Persian period                                    |
| Azor      | Unknown                      | ~400 BC                 | Late Persian rule                                 |
| Zadok     | Possibly High Priest Zadokite line | ~360 BC           | Hellenization begins                              |
| Achim     | Possibly Onias I             | ~320 BC                 | Early Ptolemaic rule                              |
| Eliud     | Possibly Simon I the Just    | ~280 BC                 | Respected Jewish leader under Ptolemies           |
| Eleazar   | Eleazar, son of Onias I      | ~260–245 BC             | Jewish High Priest                                |
| Matthan   | Mattathias Hasmonean         | ~190–160 BC             | Father of Judas Maccabee, leader of Maccabean Revolt |
| Jacob     | Possibly Alexander Jannaeus | ~120–75 BC       | Expanded Hasmonean territory                      |
| Joseph    | Possibly linked to late Hasmonean elite | ~60 BC–10 AD  | Era of Herodian dominance                         |
| Jesus     | Himself                      | ~4 BC–30/33 AD          | Claimed rightful kingship                         |
```
Based on the estimated lifespans of the figures in the genealogy, the Jacob mentioned in the genealogy would be Alexander Jannaeus, whose unusual name is also mentioned in the lineage of Mary in the Luke gospel may have been recorded by Matthew as a more familiar sounding Jacob.
Regardless of the exact identities of all figures, there is enough data here to conclude that the genealogy of Jesus in the gospel of Matthew is not a complete fabrication, but a genuine attempt to trace the lineage of Jesus through Joseph.

#### 18. Possibly the most prominent element of the gospel of Matthew is the reference to the Jewish scriptures and the fulfillment of the prophecies at seemingly every turn.
As such the gospel seems to be with a very high probability written by a prominent Jewish priest, who was also a greek empire loyalist.
There is a theory with substantial textual evidence that the gospel of Matthew was written by the Jewish priest Mattathias ben Theophilus.
That theory is also not generally accepted as it requires a pre-70AD dating of the gospel of Matthew, however, withing the context of discussed in this book, that argument is not valid, and based on other observations made in the framework that theory becomes the one more likely than the traditional dating.

#### 19. The gospel of Luke also includes a number of edits, most notably the birth narrative of Jesus.
The birth narrative seems to be full of internal contradictions and is at odds with the gospel of Matthew the events of which have some of the extremely remarkable facts corroborating to the rest of this theory.
The genealogy of Jesus in the gospel of Luke, notably has even more genuine figures from the Hasmonean dynasty down to the father of Mary, Heli, which is a short form of Eliakim, which is the same name as Joachim, which is the father of Mary in the protoevangelium of James.
If we accept that the gospel of Luke was written as a correspondence with the author of the gospel of Matthew, the the dating of it would also not be far removed.

#### 20. The gospel of Marcion deserves another look in this context.
Even though the gospel of Marcion is dated to the 2nd century, the gospel is also remarkably missing the pre-cognition of the destruction of the temple.
Much of modern textual analysis places the gospel not as an edited version of the gospel of Luke, but as an earlier version of the gospel of Luke, due to the simpler language and the lack of the birth narrative of Jesus.
