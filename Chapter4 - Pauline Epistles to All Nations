# Chapter 4 - Pauline Epistles to All Nations


1. The early dating of the gospels can make the letters of Paul more plausible as it seems Paul already has the knowledge of at least one of the gospels and the acts.

2. What is quite striking is that Paul and others write to so many different churches over the short period of time.
There is a major challenge for the traditional timeline of the apostles establishing so many churches in such a short period of time.
These churches would have to all be established, grow, keep up to date with the fastly shifting theology, and then do nearly nothing for the next 100 years.
These churches immediately showed up in every single major city in the former greek empire, and no churches showed up anywhere else.
All of the correspondence and scripture was written in Greek, and no other languages.
It is important to point out that greek was absolutely not the lingua franca in any part of the Roman empire, that was not recently part of the greek empire.
The lingua franca of the Roman empire was Latin, and that was the only language that was used in the administration and the primary language used by the authors.
If the apostles were to establish churches everywhere in the Roman empire, and not just in the former greek empire, then
we would have had the epistles to the extremely prominent cities of Mediolanum, Lutetia, Aquilea, Lugdunum, Memphis, and Londinium.
The truth is that no matter how we model the growth of the early church, it is not possible to explain the the patterns we observe.
 and then for the next 100 years do not add any new churches.

There were essentially no prominent cities in the former greek empire that were not mentioned in the acts and the epistles:

Ephesus - Also in Acts, but prominently featured in Ephesians (Ephesians 1:1).
Galatia - This region, which included cities like Antioch and Iconium, is addressed in Galatians (Galatians 1:2).
Philippi - Also mentioned in Acts, Philippi is the location of the recipients of the Epistle to the Philippians (Philippians 1:1).
Thessalonica - Featured in 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 1:1, 2 Thessalonians 1:1).
Colossae - Referenced in Colossians (Colossians 1:2).

Rome - In addition to being the destination of the Epistle to the Romans, Rome is mentioned in several other letters, including Philippians (Philippians 1:13) and 2 Timothy (2 Timothy 4:16-17), where Paul speaks of his imprisonment.
Antioch - Though central in the Book of Acts, Antioch is also mentioned in Galatians 2:11 and 1 Corinthians 9:6.

Syria - Mentioned in 1 Corinthians 16:3, Galatians 1:21, and 2 Corinthians 11:9.

Paphos - Though primarily found in Acts, Paphos is also alluded to in Titus 1:5 as a location associated with Paul's travels.
Puteoli - Mentioned in Romans 16:3-4 (though it’s more of a stop along Paul’s journey).

3. The striking statistics of the cities mentioned in the acts and the epistles are that they are all in the former greek empire, and not one mention of a city in the Roman empire that was not part of the former greek empire.
This fact makes any theory that deems Christianity as a religious and not a political movement immediately highly implausible.

4. Finally we consider the apparent minimal resistance to the acceptance of the new religion.
The new religion was accepted by the masses in the former greek empire, and not a single mention of any resistance to the new religion.
This can be explained if this was already a pre-existing imperial cult.

5. We should also consider that even though the religion was so successful at converting the masses, it still had all the conspiratorials parts to it.
Early christians used secret symbols to identify each other, they frequently met in secret, often at night in the catacombs.

6. Consider why the religion was seemingly much more prosecuted than any other religion in the Roman empire.
The Roman empire was very tolerant of other religions, and the only time they would prosecute a religion was if it was a threat to the empire.
There are some claims that other religions were not exclusive and people could believe in multiple gods, and give offerings to Zeus, but very little has ever been produced to support this very dubious claim.


7. The phrase "soldiers of Christ" is not used explicitly in the Gospels, but it appears prominently in the Pauline Epistles, particularly in the context of the Christian life being compared to a military struggle or a spiritual battle.
The most famous reference to "soldiers of Christ" comes from 2 Timothy 2:3-4, where Paul uses military imagery to describe the commitment and discipline required for Christian ministry:
2 Timothy 2:3-4 (NIV):
"Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer."
This metaphor emphasizes the dedication and discipline expected from Christians, likening them to soldiers who are focused on their mission and loyalty to their leader, which in this case is Christ Jesus.
