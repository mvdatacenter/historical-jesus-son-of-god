# Historical Jesus as the Son of God: Glory to the Newborn King

The following book presents a perspective on the historical Jesus Christ as the Son of God.
It is a unique attempt to portray Jesus as Christ and the gospels as a reliable historical source following the true historical method without any bias or prejudice.
When we talk about historical method the main goal is to determine what probably happened and that automatically excludes any supernatural explanations.
As such the book is not a theological treatise but a historical one, and we do not intend to alter the beliefs of the reader.
We think both the believer and the non-believer can truly benefit from the very unique perspective presented in this book.
When we discuss the topic of historical Jesus we attempt to gather a large amount of historical data and have a deep understanding of the historical and geographical context of the events preceding and following the life of Jesus and the rise of Christianity.
With the historical data we also attempt to gather a large amount of scholarly discourse on the topic and select the set of interesting questions about the material.
There questions include many of the ones frequently deeply discussed like why was Thomas portrayed as the doubter, or why some variants of Jesus's baptism say "you are my son. today I have begotten you".
But what we believe is unique about this book is that we also attempt to use large data analysis and state of the art artificial intelligence to identify and answer the questions that are less frequently discussed.
These questions are why nearly all list of locations in the new testament is almost precisely the same as list of most significant greek speaking cities.
Or why are the names of the Magi allegedly fabricated much later so seemingly similar to the names of imperial court positions of the past era.
Finally, with the new perspective we reopen the questions of early dating and the authorship of the gospels and the understanding of the earliest Christian movement.

While we do not intend to alter any religious beliefs of the reader, we most certainly hope to force the reader to open their mind to new interesting questions and perspectives on the historical Jesus and the rise of Christianity.
