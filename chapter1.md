# Chapter 1 - Jesus Christ, Son of Joseph and Mary Christ

In the first chapter we will list interesting questions regarding the origins and identity of Jesus Christ.

There is a long standing assumption that historical Jesus and his apostles and companions were illiterate Jewish peasants from Judea and Galilee which were a backwater of the Roman empire.
This assumption underlays nearly all of modern scholarship and is treated as gospel while there is barely any evidence to support it, while there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
Breaking this assumption can categorically change the way we assign the probabilities to various theories about the life and death of Jesus Christ and the rise of Christianity.

#### 0. Historical background
While this book questions a lot of seemingly core concepts of the historical Jesus scholarship, the general timeline is assumed to be correct.
All the arguments about time shifts and Jesus living and dying in even slightly different times are not considered in this book and not supported by any evidence.
The book assumes the historical timeline in the gospel of Matthew is correct and that Jesus was born in 4 BC and died in 33 AD.
Jesus was born in Betlehem, and did flee to Alexandria, Egypt, as an infant and spent a meaningful part of his childhood there.
Later in life he moved to Galilee, although the exact time of the move is not known. It could have been at 2 years old, but also at 12 years old.

#### 1. One of the most ridiculed but still very interesting questions is could Jesus Christ actually be the son of Joseph and Mary Christ and not the Jewish Messiah.
Mixing up the term Christos and Messiah is very deeply rooted in historiography of Jesus.
Nearly every historical treatment of the topic forgets that Christos is a Greek term for the chosen one, or a royal figure and Messiah is a Jewish term for a prophesized apocalyptic figure.
The term Christos is almost exclusively used throughout the new testament whereas the term Messiah is used only a couple of times in encounters with Jewish figures.
As such, the term Messiah seems to only be used to convince specific Jewish people that Jesus Christos is also a Jewish Messiah and not only the Greek Christos.

#### 2. Jesus could have become a Christos because he had a royal lineage through his mother Mary Christ.
The lineage of Jesus is described in the gospels of Matthew and Luke, and with the Luke gospel traditionally linking the lineage of Jesus through his mother Mary.
From that alone we know that both Mary and Joseph were also considered to be of royal lineage.
This topic has been very deeply discussed by James Tabor in his book "The Jesus Dynasty", and for an even longer expanded list of arguments and more more in depth discussion as to why Jesus descended from the Hasmonean dynasty, please refer to the book.

#### 3. Jesus's mother was Mary Christ, the last rightful heiress to the Hasmonean dynasty.
Marry's life was described in the Protoevangelium of James, which was was considered a very reliable source by the early church fathers.
Details of the Protoevangelium of James were also confirmed by the Jewish philosopher Celsus, who lived in the 2nd century AD, and was a very prominent critic of Christianity.
The protoevangelium of James lists the father of Mary as Joachim with is in agreement with the gospel of Luke, which lists the father of Mary as Heli, a short form of Eliakim, which the same name as Joachim.
Describing Mary as a perpetual virgin and the conception of Jesus as as immaculate, is in agreement with the sources on Greek princesses.
Making her a Christ, the rightful ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty would explain why there her story was recorded in this scribal biographical fashion.
Mary's brother was Simon, who was the high priest of the temple in Jerusalem, and was killed by Herod the Great in 23 BC.
Mary's birth name was Miriam, which was a very common name in the Hasmonean dynasty.
Mary's birth place was Sepphoris.
In 104 BC Alexander Jannaeus of the Hasmonean dynasty conquered Sepphoris and made it his capital.
Jannaeus is a very rare name and also mentioned in the lineage of Mary in the Luke gospel.

#### 4. Joseph was Mary's second husband and a widower, as Pantera was killed by Herod the Great soon after Jesus was conceived.
Celsus, a very well educated prominent philosopher, who used the name Panthera as one of the main arguments against the divinity of Jesus, must have had a very solid source to make such a claim, otherwise, it would carry absolutely no impact.
Shabbat 104b & Tosefta Hullin 2:22 – Contains indirect references to Jesus and Mary (Miriam), implying she was accused of adultery.

#### 5. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the city of the Hasmonean dynasty and the birthplace of the Christs.

#### 5.1. Jesus fleeing to Egypt can be a historical fact as the Hasmonean family had very close ties to Egypt.
Notably according to Luke genealogy, Jesus's great-great-great grandfather was Alexander Jannaeus, who was a very prominent figure in the Hasmonean dynasty.
The son of Jannaeus, Aristobulus II had a daughter Alexandra, married Philippion, a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty.
It is also highly 

#### 5.5. The other brothers of Jesus, James, Simon and Judas, also prominently feature in the New Testament
The importance of brothers taking over is a very common characteristic of dynasties, not religious movements.

#### 6. Antipater had been designated as Herod's successor, but his ambition and the growing animosity between him and his father led to his downfall.
As a result Joseph and Mary fled to Egypt, where they lived for several years.

#### 7. After Herod's death, Joseph and Mary returned to Galilee to the city of Nazareth, where on the hill of Sepphoris stood the palace of Herod Antipas.

#### 8. The court official titles, Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar derive from ancient Persian translations and would have been exceedingly hard to fabricate by even the most knowledgeable of scholars in the Roman empire that were not greek empire loyalists.
Sanhedrin 67a – Mentions a figure called Ben Stada, who was accused of sorcery and brought from Egypt. Some later traditions tried to connect this figure to Jesus, but the identification is debated.

#### 8. As Jesus grew up, he was heavily involved in the reconstruction of Nazareth and the surrounding areas which was destroyed by the Roman army.
Hence the gospels call him tecton, which was misleadingly later translated as carpenter.

#### 9. As with his royal lineage Jesus was also exposed to a variety of scripture and was highly educated.
The later connections of Jesus parables to many thoughts and principles of the Greek philosophers, especially the stoics, must imply Jesus was highly educated in the Greek way of life.

#### 10. Jesus was very close to and heavily influenced by his cousin John the Baptist, who christened Jesus and declared him a Christ, the rightful ruler of a Greek kingdom.
John mentions that he was not worthy to untie the sandals of Jesus, which was a common Greek expression for a disciple.
The gospel of John also mentions that Jesus was the lamb of God

#### 11. John was known to be in close contact with the religious movements in the desert and learned from them extensively.
“I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said.”

#### 12. Under the influence of his mother Mary, Jesus was still a believer in the Greek way of life and always taught others the teachings of the Greek philosophers.
The philosopher king was a very common concept in the Greek world, and Jesus was educated to become a true philosopher king.
He learned from the stoics, the cynics, and the epicureans, and his teachings were heavily influenced by them.
Do onto others as you would have them do onto you, is a very common stoic principle.

#### 13. He opposed the covenant of old testament and the preachings of the pharisees and the sadducees.
Jesus said pharisees were very hypocritical.

#### 14. He saw these groups and the Jews as taking what was rightfully his, the kindom of Judea.
He got very angry and overturned the tables of the money changers in the temple.

#### 15. The first historical mention of Jesus is in the writings of Mar Bar Serapion, a stoic philosopher, who wrote a letter to his son from prison.
The testimony of Serapion of Syria is a very important piece of evidence for the existence of Jesus.
The testimony from 73AD reads: "What advantage did the Athenians gain from putting Socrates to death? Famine and plague came upon them as a judgment for their crime.
Or the people of Samos for burning Pythagoras? In one moment their country was covered by sand.
Or the Jews by murdering their wise king? After that their kingdom was abolished.

#### 16. Testimonium Flavianum - Josephus, a Jewish historian, mentions Jesus in his Antiqu
Jesper Flavius, a Jewish historian, mentions Jesus in his Antiqus, which was written in 93 AD.
The passage reads: "At this time there appeared Jesus, a wise man. For he was a doer of startling deeds, a teacher of people who receive the truth with pleasure. 
And he gained a following both among many Jews and among the Greeks. He was the Christ."
This passage has been heavily debated by scholars, but the evidence for its authenticity is very strong.
The questions is why would a Jewish historian known to have no sympathy for Christianity call Jesus a Christ?
The only plausible explanation is that he was a Christ, a rightful heir to the Greek empire, and not a Jewish Messiah.

This passage poses a very strong conundrum for the scholars who believe that Jesus was a Jewish Messiah and not a Greek Christ.
The typical explanation is that the passage was interpolated by later Christian scribes is not supported by evidence and would require an extraordinary high level of conspiracy.

The conundrum is further deepened by the fact that in another passage that is also considered authentic by the scholars and much less likely to be an interpolation, 
Josephus mentions that Jesus the Christ was the brother of James, who was the high priest of the temple in Jerusalem.

#### 17. Cornelius Tacitus, a one of the most prominent Roman historians, mentions Jesus in his Annals, which was written in 116 AD.

The passage reads: "The founder of this name, Christ, was put to death by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius."
The overwhelming majority of scholars consider this passage to be authentic, and evidence against a possible interpolation is very strong.
This is both because of the style of writing and the difficulty of the passage to be interpolated given the high popularity and importance of his works.
A single church father would have had a very hard time to interpolate such a wide-spead work.
Given how skilled Tacitus was at historical writing it is an extraordinary corroborating evidence for Jesus being a Christ.

It is thus very compelling that the three earliest mentions of Jesus are from a stoic philosopher, a Jewish historian,
both of whom had no reason to lie about Jesus's identity and all of whom are know not to believe in Jesus's divinity clearly state that Jesus was a Christ and a king of the Jews.

#### 18. Pliny the Younger, a Roman governor, mentions Jesus in his letters to the emperor Trajan, which were written in 112 AD.
The passage reads: "But they asserted that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god."
The authenticity of this letter is sometimes debated, but regardless of its authenticity, it highlights the fact that was know about Jesus was that he was a Christ.
So even though this passage adds little to the historical evidence of existence of Jesus, it does add to the evidence that Jesus was a Christ.
Note that once again, it is not Jesus the wise man or Jesus of Nazareth, but Jesus the Christ.

#### 19. Suetonius, a Roman historian, mentions Jesus in his Life of Claudius, which was written in 121 AD.
Suetonius writes briefly about Jesus as an instigator. This is notable as highlights Jesus was not just a preacher but a political figure.

#### 20. Lucian of Samosata, a satirist, mentions Jesus in his work The Passing of Peregrinus, which was written in 170 AD.
The part of the passage reads "and they worship the same crucified sophist and live after his laws."
In here Jesus is called a sophist, which was a common term for a philosopher in the Greek world.

This passage is much later, but highlights the fact that Jesus was considered a philosopher by the Greeks which would corroborate Jesus's noble Greek lineage.
Again, we are talking about cultural ties here, someone who was closely related to and promoting Greek culture.

#### 21. Clark Kent argument
There is something to be said about the fact of the wealth of historical records surrounding Jesus Christ and his apostles.
"In total, we have 42 sources dating to less than 150 years after Jesus's death that mention his existence, 9 of which are non-Christian.
In comparison, regarding Julius Caesar, only five sources report his military operations."

The argument goes that if Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, or just a wise man, why would there be so many sources mentioning him?
There were no books about Clark Kent, but there are many about Superman.
For this argument we have to consider both independent sources and the sources that are not Christian.

The wealth of the available records can would be hard to explain by Jesus without supernatural powers or not being a very prominent political figure of major significance.
In fact the only non-supernatural plausible explanation may be that Christianity was a loyalist movement attempting to restore the Greek empire.
