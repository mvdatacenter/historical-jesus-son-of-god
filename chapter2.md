# Chapter 2 - He Truly was the Son of God

Next we re-investigate Jesus's royal claim within the context of the greek empire. We want to show that all the titles given to Jesus were titles given to the rulers of the greek empire.
That the events surrounding Jesus's life were consistent with the events surrounding the rulers of the greek empire and were deeply rooted in greek imperial cult.

#### 1. Jesus is the Son of God.
Alexander was the son of God and so were the Seleucids. The title was used for the rulers of the greek empire.

#### 2. Jesus is the Son Of Father.
The well known ruler of Egypt, Cleopatra, was given the title "father loving goddess".
Seleucus IV Philopator was also given the title "father loving god".
This or similar title was used by countless other rulers in the greek world.
In this context the multiple references to being the only begotten son of the father signify the rightful heir, and the only rightful claim to the throne.

#### 3. Jesus is the Logos, the Word of God.
The Stoics, particularly Zeno of Citium (c. 334–262 BCE) and later Chrysippus, played a significant role in further developing the idea of Logos.
In Stoic thought, Logos became the rational principle that permeates and organizes the cosmos.
It was understood as a divine rationality that was present in the universe, giving it structure and coherence.
Very notably, Philo of Alexandria who was closely related to the Herodian and Hasmonean dynasties and contemporary to Jesus, described the Logos as a mediator between God and the world.
Thus if Jesus and some of the other members of the court were indeed visiting Alexandria in Jesus's youth, they must have had close expose to the idea of logos.
Based on the age difference and the family relations, Jesus would have likely treated Philo as his distinguished uncle, and so would John the Evangelist.

Notably in the context of the greek empire, the Logos was a divine principle that was both God's expression and as such the ruler would have been considered to speak the Logos of the God.
This is consistent with the idea of multiple quotes as nobody can get to the father except through me.

Notably Philo described the Logos as the firstborn son of God, and so the rightful heir to the throne and the intermediary between God and the world.

Even though countless philosophers claimed rulers should follow the Logos and called the Logos the divine, the title of the Logos itself does not appear to have been given to any ruler prior to John's gospel.
And as the idea of Logos in John appears so closely to the evolution of the Logos idea from Philo, it increases the likelihood that indeed John was in a close contact with Philo.

#### 3. Jesus is the God manifested in the flesh.
Epiphanes is a title given to multiple rulers, such as Antiochus IV and Ptolemy V. 
The title signify the ruler is the god manifested in the flesh.

#### 4. Jesus is the Savior of the World.
Essentially every other ruler of the greek empire was given Soter as a title, which means savior.
The first Ptolemy was given the title "Soter", and so was the last king of the greek kingdom Strato II Soter.
Antiochus III was even given the title "The God the Savior".

#### 5. Jesus is the Good Shepherd.
Plato taught that a true philosopher king is a good shepherd. Likely it stuck as a title for Jesus.

#### 6. Jesus is the Light of the World.
Here the title relates to the cave from Plato's Republic.
The the journey from darkness to light symbolizes the philosopher’s ascent from ignorance to knowledge, particularly knowledge of the Good.

#### 7. Jesus is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
Similarly, King of Kings and Lord of Lords was a title used for the rulers of empires, not only greeks, but also of India and Persia.

#### 8. Jesus is the Prince of Peace.
Ptolemy V Epiphanes famous of the Rosetta stone, was called the bringer of peace.

#### 9. Jesus is the Word.
The Stoics, particularly Zeno of Citium (c. 334–262 BCE) and later Chrysippus, played a significant role in further developing the idea of Logos. In Stoic thought, Logos became the rational principle that permeates and organizes the cosmos.
 It was understood as a divine rationality that was present in the universe, giving it structure and coherence.
The Stoics taught that humans should live in accordance with the Logos, which represented divine reason and the natural law of the universe.
 For the Stoics, the Logos was both immanent and cosmic, meaning it was part of everything and governed all things.

For Philo, the Logos was a mediator between God and the world.
He described the Logos as a divine principle that was both God's expression and the agent of creation.
 Philo’s Logos was similar to the Stoic idea, but with a more direct connection to the Jewish monotheistic tradition.

#### 10. Jesus has 12 apostles.
 Apostles were a common term for the emissaries of the greek empire.
 Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kings often sent out ἀπόστολοι as official emissaries or envoys on diplomatic missions.
 The emissaries represented the kings' political will and spread decrees across the empire.

#### 11. Jesus was crucified for being the King of The Jews
This is the actual question that was asked to Jesus by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate.
If Jesus really had the title of the last rightful heir to the greek empire, then he would have indeed posed a threat to the Roman empire.
Generally apocalyptic preachers would not have been given this punishment, but a rightful heir to the greek empire would have been.
Typically the punishment was reserved for those who posed a threat to the Roman empire.

#### 12. The writing on the cross was "The King of the Jews"
In the context of crucifixion being a punishment for those who posed a threat to the Roman empire, it would make sense that Romans would post a note like this not to mock Jesus, but to warn others against rebelling against the Roman empire.

#### 13. Jesus was not left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers.
Typically the bodies of the crucified were left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers, but Jesus was taken down from the cross and buried in a tomb.
This is consistent with the Roman being harsh but ultimately not trying to overstep their bounds.
In a case of a slave committing a crime, Jesus would be left on the cross, but as they could expect more rebellion if their cruelty had no bounds, it is conceivable that they would have allowed Jesus to be buried.

#### 13. Parables of Jesus.
There are many parables of Jesus that seem to hint at him being a good ambassador of a future kingdom.
The parable of the talents, the parable of the sower, the parable of the lost sheep, the parable of the prodigal son, the parable of the good samaritan, the parable of the wedding feast, the parable of the ten virgins, the parable of the wise and foolish builders, the parable of the rich fool, the parable of the barren fig tree, the parable of the great banquet, the parable of the mustard seed, the parable of the yeast, the parable of the hidden treasure, the parable of the pearl, the parable of the net,
 all seem to hint at a future kingdom that Jesus would rule over.

## Holy Mary, Mother of God, Perpetual Virgin, Queen of Heaven

#### 1. Mary was the rightful heiress to the Hasmonean dynasty and so the royal titles we know very well today also correspond to the titles of the Greek rulers.
There were countless greek female rulers with highly distinguished, divine titles, such as Cleopatra, who was also a common name in the Hasmonean dynasty.

#### 2. Holy Mary mother of God.
As Jesus was the Son of God, as a rightful heir, Mary as the mother of future ruler would have been considered the Mother of God.

"Mother of the Lord" (Μήτηρ τοῦ Κυρίου) – Found in Luke 1:43, where Elizabeth calls Mary the “Mother of my Lord.” This implies royal status since "Lord" (Kyrios) could mean a divine or kingly ruler.
Elizabeth greets Mary: "And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"

#### 3. Mary was a perpetual virgin.
A very common trope in the greek world was that the royal women were pure often called perpetual virgins. This is something that fits really well with the idea of Mary as royal but seems at odds with the idea of Mary as a mother to Jesus.

#### 4. Mary was the Queen of Heaven.
The earliest known hymns and prayers to Mary refer to her as
Βασίλισσα τῶν Οὐρανῶν – explicit royal status.

"The Woman Clothed with the Sun" – Revelation 12:1
"A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head."
While this passage refers to Israel, early Christian writings (Hippolytus, 3rd century AD) link it to Mary as a royal mother figure.

#### 5. Mary was Blessed among all women
Highlighting Mary's royal lineage

#### 6. Mary was the New Eve
"New Eve" – Early Church Fathers (Justin Martyr, Irenaeus) described Mary as the new Eve, implying a role in a divine dynasty.
Protoevangelium of James (c. 2nd century AD) – While emphasizing her perpetual virginity, it also hints at a priestly and royal lineage, calling her “set apart for the Lord.”
