# Chapter 2 - He Truly was the Son of God

Next we re-investigate Jesus's royal claim within the context of the greek empire. We want to show that all the titles given to Jesus were titles given to the rulers of the greek empire.
That the events surrounding Jesus's life were consistent with the events surrounding the rulers of the greek empire and were deeply rooted in greek imperial cult.

#### 0. Jesus is the Christ.
In the gospels and all the earliest materials we can see by far the most common title given to Jesus is Christ. It is not the Messiah, but the Christ.
In the very few cases the word Messiah is used, the gospels clearly state that Messiah is the Hebrew translation of the word Christ.
Christ is the title used by Josephus, Christ is used by Pliny the Younger, Christ is used by Tacitus, Christ is used by Suetonius, Christ is used by Paul. 
Christ is the only term used by Jesus own highly educated, greek speaking brother James.
It is not the other way around, Jesus was not actually called the Messiah, which later morphed into Christ.
The gospels just use the Messiah to explain to the Hebrews what the Christ was, not the other way around.
We should look at the usage of the word Christ in the context of the greek empire and not purely in the context of the Hebrew apocalyptic literature.

#### 1. Jesus is the Son of God.
Alexander was the son of God and so were the Seleucids, Ptolemys. The title was used for the rulers of the greek empire.

#### 2. Jesus is the Son Of Father.
The well known ruler of Egypt, Cleopatra, was given the title "father loving goddess".
Seleucus IV Philopator was also given the title "father loving god".
This or similar title was used by countless other rulers in the greek world.
In this context the multiple references to being the only-begotten son of the father signify the rightful heir, and the only rightful claim to the throne.

#### 3. Jesus is the Logos, the Word of God.
The Stoics, particularly Zeno of Citium (c. 334–262 BCE) and later Chrysippus, played a significant role in further developing the idea of Logos.
In Stoic thought, Logos became the rational principle that permeates and organizes the cosmos.
It was understood as a divine rationality that was present in the universe, giving it structure and coherence.
Very notably, Philo of Alexandria who was closely related to the Herodian and Hasmonean dynasties and contemporary to Jesus, described the Logos as a mediator between God and the world.
Thus, if Jesus and some of the other members of the court were indeed visiting Alexandria in Jesus's youth, they must have had close exposure to the idea of logos.
Based on the age difference and the family relations, Jesus would have likely treated Philo as his distinguished uncle, and so would John the Evangelist.

Notably in the context of the greek empire, the Logos was a divine principle that was both God's expression and as such the ruler would have been considered to speak the Logos of the God.
This is consistent with the idea of multiple quotes as nobody can get to the father except through me.

Notably Philo described the Logos as the firstborn son of God, and so the rightful heir to the throne and the intermediary between God and the world.

Even though countless philosophers claimed rulers should follow the Logos and called the Logos the divine, the title of the Logos itself does not appear to have been given to any ruler prior to John's gospel.
And as the idea of Logos in John appears so closely to the evolution of the Logos idea from Philo, it increases the likelihood that indeed John was in a close contact with Philo.

#### 3. Jesus is the God manifested in the flesh.
Epiphanes is a title given to multiple rulers, such as Antiochus IV and Ptolemy V. 
The title signify the ruler is the god manifested in the flesh.

#### 4. Jesus is the Savior of the World.
Essentially every other ruler of the greek empire was given Soter as a title, which means savior.
The first Ptolemy was given the title "Soter", and so was the last king of the greek kingdom Strato II Soter.
Antiochus III was even given the title "The God the Savior".

#### 5. Jesus is the Good Shepherd.
Plato taught that a true philosopher king is a good shepherd. Likely it stuck as a title for Jesus.

#### 6. Jesus is the Light of the World.
Here the title relates to the cave from Plato's Republic.
The journey from darkness to light symbolizes the philosopher’s ascent from ignorance to knowledge, particularly knowledge of the Good.

#### 7. Jesus is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
Similarly, King of Kings and Lord of Lords was a title used for the rulers of empires, not only greeks, but also of India and Persia.

#### 8. Jesus is the Prince of Peace.
Ptolemy V Epiphanes famous of the Rosetta stone, was called the bringer of peace.

#### 9. Jesus is the Word.
The Stoics, particularly Zeno of Citium (c. 334–262 BCE) and later Chrysippus, played a significant role in further developing the idea of Logos. In Stoic thought, Logos became the rational principle that permeates and organizes the cosmos.
 It was understood as a divine rationality that was present in the universe, giving it structure and coherence.
The Stoics taught that humans should live in accordance with the Logos, which represented divine reason and the natural law of the universe.
 For the Stoics, the Logos was both immanent and cosmic, meaning it was part of everything and governed all things.

For Philo, the Logos was a mediator between God and the world.
He described the Logos as a divine principle that was both God's expression and the agent of creation.
 Philo’s Logos was similar to the Stoic idea, but with a more direct connection to the Jewish monotheistic tradition.

#### 10. Jesus has 12 apostles.
 Apostles were a common term for the emissaries of the greek empire.
 Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kings often sent out ἀπόστολοι as official emissaries or envoys on diplomatic missions.
 The emissaries represented the kings' political will and spread decrees across the empire.

#### 11. Jesus was crucified for being the King of The Jews
This is the actual question that was asked to Jesus by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate.
If Jesus really had the title of the last rightful heir to the greek empire, then he would have indeed posed a threat to the Roman empire.
Generally apocalyptic preachers would not have been given this punishment, but a rightful heir to the greek empire would have been.
Typically, the punishment was reserved for those who posed a threat to the Roman empire.

#### 12. The writing on the cross was "The King of the Jews"
In the context of crucifixion being a punishment for those who posed a threat to the Roman empire, it would make sense that Romans would post a note like this not to mock Jesus, but to warn others against rebelling against the Roman empire.

#### 13. Jesus was not left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers.
Typically, the bodies of the crucified were left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers, but Jesus was taken down from the cross and buried in a tomb.
This is consistent with the Roman being harsh but ultimately not trying to overstep their bounds.
In a case of a slave committing a crime, Jesus would be left on the cross, but as they could expect more rebellion if their cruelty had no bounds, it is conceivable that they would have allowed Jesus to be buried.

#### 13. Parables of Jesus.
There are many parables of Jesus that seem to hint at him being a good ambassador of a future kingdom.
The parable of the talents, the parable of the sower, the parable of the lost sheep, the parable of the prodigal son, the parable of the good samaritan, the parable of the wedding feast, the parable of the ten virgins, the parable of the wise and foolish builders, the parable of the rich fool, the parable of the barren fig tree, the parable of the great banquet, the parable of the mustard seed, the parable of the yeast, the parable of the hidden treasure, the parable of the pearl, the parable of the net,
 all seem to hint at a future kingdom that Jesus would rule over.

### 14. Kingdom of God was a common term for the greek empire and the greek kingdoms.
The Hellenistic rulers weren’t just kings—they were divine monarchs ruling by the will of the gods.
Βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ is a very common pre christian greek term to describe greek kingdoms, notably used in the writings of Philo of Alexandria who likely influenced Jesus and early Christian writers.
This culture was very deeply rooted in the Greek, Persian and Egyptian royal cultures for centuries by that time.
And so restoring a kingdom of God on earth much more likely refers to restoring the greek empire than to some abstract idea of a spiritual kingdom.
This is something fresh in the mind of Philo and Jesus himself.

### 15. Jesus birth was represented as a new star in the sky.
This is a common trope in the greek world, notably used for the birth of Alexander the Great.
The Ptolemies of Egypt (Greek rulers after Alexander) often linked their divine status to stars and celestial phenomena.
Ptolemy III (246–222 BC) was honored with a new star appearing, supposedly confirming his divine favor.
The tradition actually was transferred to the Roman empire, where the birth of Augustus was also represented as a new star in the sky, and so was the death and deification of Julius Caesar.

The story of Ptolemy III (246–222 BC) and a celestial sign is linked to the Canopus Decree (238 BC), an inscription issued by Egyptian priests during his reign. This decree honors Ptolemy III and his wife, Berenice II, and includes references to astronomical phenomena associated with his rule.

The Canopus Decree (238 BC)
This decree was issued by Egyptian priests to honor Ptolemy III for his military campaigns and religious patronage.
It mentions a new star appearing in the sky, likely in connection with his divine status.
The decree also orders the addition of a leap day to the Egyptian calendar, demonstrating Ptolemy III’s association with astronomical knowledge.
Callimachus (Greek Poet, 3rd Century BC)
In his lost work, Aetia, Callimachus possibly referenced Berenice’s Lock, a constellation myth that was linked to a celestial omen for Ptolemy III.
The myth suggests that Berenice II dedicated a lock of her hair for her husband's victory, which disappeared and was later seen as a new star in the sky (Coma Berenices).
Manetho (Egyptian Historian, 3rd Century BC)
Though most of Manetho's works are lost, later writers reference his accounts of omens, stars, and divine portents during the reign of Ptolemy III.

Antiochus III (the Great, r. 222–187 BC) was said to have had a new star appear before his greatest campaigns.
Seleucid coins often depicted Zeus with a star, symbolizing divine rule.

Mithridates VI of Pontus (120–63 BC)
Celestial Sign:
A comet appeared at his birth, interpreted as a sign of his future greatness.
Source: Justin’s Epitome of Pompeius Trogus mentions his divine status.

### 16. Jesus was buried in a tomb.

No other crucified person was buried in a tomb. They were left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers.
A regular revolutionary would have been left on the cross, but someone with a royal lineage could be given an extraordinary exception.
As the Romans likely could have conceived of Jesus being more divine by his royal lineage, they may have already be afraid of Gods wrath at the time of crucifixion.

### 17. Jesus was crucified on Wednesday in 31 AD.

It is commonly believed that Jesus was crucified on Friday, but all the Christian sources actually very directly say that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday.
This is not a new idea, but but for some unknown reason it is ignored by nearly all scholars.
The Friday crucifixion is a later liturgical development and not present in the bible or earliest Christian sources.
All gospels agree that Jesus was crucified on the day of preparation for the Passover.
The common misunderstanding is that the day of preparation is the day before the Sabbath, which is Saturday, but in this context the passover is also a Sabbath.
So for the texts to be consistent, the day of preparation must be Thursday. 
If we assume Friday we have trials before Annas, Caiaphas, Sanhedrin, Herod, and Pilate, mocking, beatings, travel, flogging, crucifixion, death, burial before sunset all supposedly occurred on the same morning, which is highly implausible.
There is obviously the extremely common statement that Jesus was in the tomb for three days and three nights which only works if we assume Jesus was crucified on Thursday.

To summarize:
Wednesday crucifixion in 34 AD (April 21 Julian) fits all the evidence:
John 19:31 explicitly distinguishes the Sabbath following Jesus' death as a "high day" (i.e., not a regular Saturday Sabbath).
Leviticus 23:7 establishes that Nisan 15 is a mandatory Sabbath regardless of weekday—this is the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
Matthew 28:1 does indeed say "after the Sabbaths" (plural: σαββάτων), and this is not a scribal error.
Mark 16:1 – “When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices...”
→ This refers to buying spices after the first (Thursday) Sabbath, so it must be Friday.
“Three days and three nights” (Matthew 12:40) cannot be forced into a Friday-to-Sunday window without manipulating Jewish idiom or chronology.
Luke 23:56 – “They returned and prepared spices and ointments; and rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.”
→ This refers to preparing spices on Friday, and then resting on Saturday.

Day	Event
Here’s the count if Jesus died Wednesday afternoon:
Buried before sunset Wednesday
Night 1: Wednesday night
Day 1: Thursday (High Sabbath)
Night 2: Thursday night
Day 2: Friday (spice preparation day)
Night 3: Friday night, third night in the tomb
Day 3: Saturday (Weekly Sabbath), third day in the tomb
Night 4: Jesus resurrected at the sundown of Saturday, that is the beginning of Sunday in Jewish calendar
Day 4: Sunday (first day of the week) the tomb was found empty
If resurrection occurred just after sunset on Saturday, it is exactly three days and three nights.
Leading to Thursday, Friday, and Saturday being the three days and three nights, and the evening of Saturday when the resurrection allegedly occurred is the beginning of Sunday. So this is fully consistent with the numerous references to the resurrection on Sunday.

Why the tomb was found empty Sunday:
Because the women waited until the Sabbath ended (Saturday evening), then came at dawn Sunday (Matthew 28:1, Luke 24:1). That’s when the resurrection was discovered — not when it happened.

So:
✔ Three full days and nights: ✅
✔ Resurrection not seen, only tomb found empty Sunday: ✅
✔ Fits Jewish counting and Gospel timeline: ✅

Then the crucifixion must have happened on Wednesday, April 21, 31 AD.

Note that for example, the possibly oldest preserved Christian text, the Didache, explicitly states that fast on Wednesday and Friday.
Friday is likely linked to Sabbath, but Wednesday is a new addition and most logically it would be the day of crucifixion.

Notably the earliest Christian writers outside the gospels and before Tertullian (c. 160–220 AD) that talk about the resurrection are Justin Martyr (c. 100–165 AD) and Barnabas (c. 70–135 AD), both of whom place the resurrection on at the start of Sunday, but do not list the day of crucifixion.

### 17. Jesus survived crucifixion

In this context it is not even inconceivable that the Romans would have allowed Jesus to be picked up from the cross before death. It is highly speculative, but it has a really strong explanation power to it. 
Perhaps something as trivial as lightnings and thunders could have already made the Roman soldiers and the crowds to superstitiously believe he truly was the son of God and got scared.
Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus did receive an agreement from Pilate to pull him from the cross early, and Jesus could have simply survived the trauma and barely alive.
And on the third day he got so much better that he was able to walk around and talk to the apostles and show his wounds.
Then Jesus died fifty days later due to infection and all started to believe he was resurrected and ascended to heaven.

Notably all burial care was done at the time of death. It was not Sabbath yet, and they had allegedly plenty of time to do bury Jesus on Friday.
Yet why would they still tend to Jesus body on Sunday morning? This could have been a medical care, not just continuation of unfinished burial process.
The eventual death of Jesus from infection, especially given the severe wounds he suffered, adds a realistic angle to the story. 
After his brief recovery, it would be plausible for his body to succumb to the damage sustained during the crucifixion. 
This would also explain why the apostles continued to believe in his resurrection, even after his eventual death. 
They might have interpreted his survival and brief recovery as divine intervention and seen his later death as part of a larger divine plan.
Perhaps all the doubting really did happen as the apostles were certain that Jesus was dead as they were not eyewitnesses to the event itself.

Further support to the story is In Mark 15:44, Pilate is described as being surprised by the news of Jesus’ death, as he expected Jesus to have been on the cross longer. Mark states:
"Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph."
This detail suggests that Jesus’ death was unexpectedly quick. Crucifixion was a prolonged form of execution designed to last for hours, if not days, as the condemned person typically died from a combination of blood loss, exposure, and suffocation. For Pilate to be surprised, it could imply that Jesus' death occurred more quickly than usual, which is significant because:

Roman soldiers were typically experienced in carrying out executions, and the death on the cross was intended to be slow and torturous.
The standard time for death was several hours, and for someone to die within less than six hours, as Jesus did, would have been unusual. 
Pilate's surprise may indicate that Jesus' death was significantly quicker than expected.
It may be that Jesus wasn’t fully dead at the time he was taken down from the cross. 
It seems likely small omens in the sky mixed with fear in the crowd and even among the soldiers made Pilate more receptive to Joseph of Arimathea's request without carefully checking Jesus fully passed away.
Note that Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the Sanhedrin, and he was likely a person of influence making it even more likely Pilate would have been more receptive to his request.

When the Roman soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, blood and water flowed out, which is often interpreted as a sign of death.
"Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water." (John 19:34)
Trauma, scourging, and prolonged stress could have caused a buildup of fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion) or around the heart (pericardial effusion).
If pierced, these fluids could flow out as a mix of clear fluid ("water") and blood.
If Jesus were completely dead, the blood would have likely clotted in his body, and the wound wouldn't produce such a "sudden flow."
The fact that both blood and water "flowed out" immediately suggests the body still had some circulatory activity, meaning the heart might not have fully stopped yet.
Pleural or pericardial effusion does NOT mean the person is already dead—it can happen before death in cases of extreme shock or injury.
It would be likely more than enough to convince the centurion that Jesus was dead and pass the news to Pilate.
Joseph of Arimathea taking Jesus to his own garden to bury him there, is also highly suspect.
The excuse that Jesus had to be buried quickly before the Sabbath in a temporary grave may actually be a plot to hide the fact that Jesus was not dead yet.
It is also worth noting that using armed guards to protect the tomb is not a common practice. 
Armed guards when the person is still alive would make a lot more sense.
For example some of the opponents of Jesus suspected a foul play and wanted to make sure Jesus was really dead and not taken down from the cross alive.

Many scholars point out that Arimathea is a place that does not exist, and so it is likely a made up name.
However, Ar-Ram, also known as Ramathaim, today better known as Ramallah or Ram Allah, is an ancient town a few kilometers north of Jerusalem that is more than likely to be that place.
We actually already know Ramallah from the Old Testament, where it is mentioned as the birthplace of Samuel.
Notably early versions of Septuagint translated the birthplace as "Αρμαθαιμ" in 1 Samuel 1:1, while hebrew text used Ramathaim.
It is a natural translation of the name into Greek, and the Septuagint should be considered as a strong evidence that Arimathea is indeed Ramallah.
It is also notable enough and close enough to Jerusalem that it would have been very logical origin place for a prominent member of the Sanhedrin.
It is also notable enough to have been mentioned in the gospels as a place elevating the status of Joseph of Arimathea and familiar enough to the people of the story to not be needing any further explanation.
The doubting found in all the gospels is also highly natural.
Simply Jesus being tortured and left for near-certain death but then eventually surviving would have still been treated as a miracle.
Most likely the apostles really did not believe much in miracles and were not expecting Jesus to survive.

Finally, many scholars point out that the victim of crucifixion were always left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers in every known record.
However, even Philo of Alexandria, featured in many discussions in this book for unrelated reasons, described a case of numerous Jew insurrectionists in Alexandria in 38AD were actually taken down from the cross in exchange for a bribe.
It is not completely clear from the text, but the more plausible reading is that some of the victims may have been taken down from the cross before they died.
In this light it should not be considered as implausible that a member of the Sanhedrin would have been able to bargain with the centurion to convince Pilate Jesus already died.

Josephus, Jewish War 4.5.2 (333):
He says he recognized three of his acquaintances being crucified, asked for their removal, and one of them survived.

Summarizing, although partially speculative, there is a lot of speculation that matches unexpectedly well on close inspection.
We need to consider the possibilities that Jesus really died and then numerous propaganda stories were created with strictly controlled narrative.
The non-resurrection theory actually does suffer very substantially from the problem of consistent narrative.
The ungrounded claims would not be corroborated by everyone in the same way.
There is bound to be more serious discrepancies in the story and more variants of the story.

The other alternative is that there really was empty tomb and misunderstanding. For example, Joseph and Nicodemus really did use a temporary grave and then moved Jesus to a different grave without telling anyone. Then the women came to the grave and found it empty and spread the news to Peter and John and so the story started to spread.
Then the empty grave was undeniable but everyone doubted the resurrection as they had no certainty that Jesus was resurrected or simply his body was secretly moved.

So here we need to consider the plausibility that Jesus survived because of luck or a conspiracy of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, and contrast it with the alternative of the event being completely fabricated.


## Holy Mary, Mother of God, Perpetual Virgin, Queen of Heaven

#### 1. Mary was the rightful heiress to the Hasmonean dynasty and so the royal titles we know very well today also correspond to the titles of the Greek rulers.
There were countless greek female rulers with highly distinguished, divine titles, such as Cleopatra, who was also a common name in the Hasmonean dynasty.

#### 2. Holy Mary mother of God.
As Jesus was the Son of God, as a rightful heir, Mary as the mother of future ruler would have been considered the Mother of God.

"Mother of the Lord" (Μήτηρ τοῦ Κυρίου) – Found in Luke 1:43, where Elizabeth calls Mary the “Mother of my Lord.” This implies royal status since "Lord" (Kyrios) could mean a divine or kingly ruler.
Elizabeth greets Mary: "And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"

#### 3. Mary was a perpetual virgin.
A very common trope in the greek world was that the royal women were pure often called perpetual virgins. This is something that fits really well with the idea of Mary as royal but seems at odds with the idea of Mary as a mother to Jesus.

#### 4. Mary was the Queen of Heaven.
The earliest known hymns and prayers to Mary refer to her as
Βασίλισσα τῶν Οὐρανῶν – explicit royal status.

"The Woman Clothed with the Sun" – Revelation 12:1
"A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head."
While this passage refers to Israel, early Christian writings (Hippolytus, 3rd century AD) link it to Mary as a royal mother figure.

#### 5. Mary was Blessed among all women
Highlighting Mary's royal lineage

#### 6. Mary was the New Eve
"New Eve" – Early Church Fathers (Justin Martyr, Irenaeus) described Mary as the new Eve, implying a role in a divine dynasty.
Protoevangelium of James (c. 2nd century AD) – While emphasizing her perpetual virginity, it also hints at a priestly and royal lineage, calling her “set apart for the Lord.”
