# Chapter 2 - He Truly was the Son of God

Next we re-investigate Jesus's royal claim within the context of the greek empire. We want to show that all the titles given to Jesus were titles given to the rulers of the greek empire.
That the events surrounding Jesus's life were consistent with the events surrounding the rulers of the greek empire and were deeply rooted in greek imperial cult.

#### 1. Jesus is the Son of God.
Alexander was the son of God and so were the Seleucids. The title was used for the rulers of the greek empire.

#### 2. Jesus is the Son Of Father.
The well known ruler of Egypt, Cleopatra, was given the title "father loving goddess".
Seleucus IV Philopator was also given the title "father loving god".

#### 3. Jesus is the God manifested in the flesh.
Epiphanes is a title given to Antiochus IV and Ptolemy V to signify he is the god manifested in the flesh.

#### 4. Jesus is the Savior of the World.
Essentially every other ruler of the greek empire was given Soter as a title, which means savior.
The first Ptolemy was given the title "Soter", and so was the last king of the greek kingdom Strato II Soter.
Antiochus III was even given the title "The God the Savior".

#### 5. Jesus is the Good Shepherd.
Plato taught that a true philosopher king is a good shepherd. Likely it stuck as a title for Jesus.

#### 6. Jesus is the Light of the World.
Here the title relates to the cave from Plato's Republic.
The the journey from darkness to light symbolizes the philosopher’s ascent from ignorance to knowledge, particularly knowledge of the Good.

#### 7. Jesus is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
Similarly, King of Kings and Lord of Lords was a title used for the rulers of empires, not only greeks, but also of India and Persia.

#### 8. Jesus is the Prince of Peace.
Ptolemy V Epiphanes famous of the Rosetta stone, was called the bringer of peace.

#### 9. Jesus is the Word.
The Stoics, particularly Zeno of Citium (c. 334–262 BCE) and later Chrysippus, played a significant role in further developing the idea of Logos. In Stoic thought, Logos became the rational principle that permeates and organizes the cosmos.
 It was understood as a divine rationality that was present in the universe, giving it structure and coherence.
The Stoics taught that humans should live in accordance with the Logos, which represented divine reason and the natural law of the universe.
 For the Stoics, the Logos was both immanent and cosmic, meaning it was part of everything and governed all things.

For Philo, the Logos was a mediator between God and the world.
He described the Logos as a divine principle that was both God's expression and the agent of creation.
 Philo’s Logos was similar to the Stoic idea, but with a more direct connection to the Jewish monotheistic tradition.

#### 10. Jesus has 12 apostles.
 Apostles were a common term for the emissaries of the greek empire.
 Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kings often sent out ἀπόστολοι as official emissaries or envoys on diplomatic missions.
 The emissaries represented the kings' political will and spread decrees across the empire.

#### 11. Jesus was crucified for being the King of The Jews
This is the actual question that was asked to Jesus by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate.
If Jesus really had the title of the last rightful heir to the greek empire, then he would have indeed posed a threat to the Roman empire.
Generally apocalyptic preachers would not have been given this punishment, but a rightful heir to the greek empire would have been.
Typically the punishment was reserved for those who posed a threat to the Roman empire.

#### 12. The writing on the cross was "The King of the Jews"
In the context of crucifixion being a punishment for those who posed a threat to the Roman empire, it would make sense that Romans would post a note like this not to mock Jesus, but to warn others against rebelling against the Roman empire.

#### 13. Jesus was not left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers.
Typically the bodies of the crucified were left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers, but Jesus was taken down from the cross and buried in a tomb.
This is consistent with the Roman being harsh but ultimately not trying to overstep their bounds.
In a case of a slave committing a crime, Jesus would be left on the cross, but as they could expect more rebellion if their cruelty had no bounds, it is conceivable that they would have allowed Jesus to be buried.

#### 13. Parables of Jesus.
There are many parables of Jesus that seem to hint at him being a good ambassador of a future kingdom.
The parable of the talents, the parable of the sower, the parable of the lost sheep, the parable of the prodigal son, the parable of the good samaritan, the parable of the wedding feast, the parable of the ten virgins, the parable of the wise and foolish builders, the parable of the rich fool, the parable of the barren fig tree, the parable of the great banquet, the parable of the mustard seed, the parable of the yeast, the parable of the hidden treasure, the parable of the pearl, the parable of the net,
 all seem to hint at a future kingdom that Jesus would rule over.
