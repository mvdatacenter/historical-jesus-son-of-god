# Chapter 4 - Pauline Epistles to All Nations


#### 1. The early dating of the gospels can make the letters of Paul more plausible as it seems Paul already has the knowledge of at least one of the gospels and the acts.

Many scholars dispute the existence of Paul based on the striking contradiction in mainstream scholarship that authors of Pauline epistles seem to have the knowledge of the gospels and the acts, and yet the gospels and the acts are unanimously dated to be written after the Pauline epistles.
In here the existence of Paul can once more be reconsidered if we acknowledge the early dating of the gospels and the gospel of John in being written by an eyewitness of Jesus's life.

#### 2. What is quite striking is that Paul and others write to so many different churches over the short period of time.
There is a major challenge for the traditional timeline of the apostles establishing so many churches in such a short period of time.
These churches would have to all be established, grow, keep up to date with the fastly shifting theology, and then do nearly nothing for the next 100 years.
These churches immediately showed up in every single major city in the former greek empire, and no churches showed up anywhere else.
All of the correspondence and scripture was written in Greek, and no other languages.
It is important to point out that greek was absolutely not the lingua franca in any part of the Roman empire, that was not recently part of the greek empire.
The lingua franca of the Roman empire was Latin, and that was the only language that was used in the administration and the primary language used by the authors.
If the apostles were to establish churches everywhere in the Roman empire, and not just in the former greek empire, then
we would have had the epistles to the extremely prominent cities of Mediolanum, Lutetia, Aquilea, Lugdunum, Memphis, and Londinium.
The truth is that no matter how we model the growth of the early church, it is not possible to explain the the patterns we observe.
 and then for the next 100 years do not add any new churches.

There were essentially no prominent cities in the former greek empire that were not mentioned in the acts and the epistles:

#### 3. The striking statistics of the cities mentioned in the acts and the epistles are that they are all in the former greek empire, and not one mention of a city in the Roman empire that was not part of the former greek empire.
This fact makes any theory that deems Christianity as a religious and not a political movement immediately highly implausible.

#### 4. Finally we consider the apparent minimal resistance to the acceptance of the new religion.
The new religion was accepted by the masses in the former greek empire, and not a single mention of any resistance to the new religion.
This can be explained if this was already a pre-existing imperial cult.

#### 5. We should also consider that even though the religion was so successful at converting the masses, it still had all the conspiratorials parts to it.
Early christians used secret symbols to identify each other, they frequently met in secret, often at night in the catacombs.

#### 6. Consider why the religion was seemingly much more prosecuted than any other religion in the Roman empire.
The Roman empire was very tolerant of other religions, and the only time they would prosecute a religion was if it was a threat to the empire.
There are some claims that other religions were not exclusive and people could believe in multiple gods, and give offerings to Zeus, but very little has ever been produced to support this very dubious claim.


#### 7. The phrase "soldiers of Christ" is not used explicitly in the Gospels, but it appears prominently in the Pauline Epistles, particularly in the context of the Christian life being compared to a military struggle or a spiritual battle.
The most famous reference to "soldiers of Christ" comes from 2 Timothy 2:3-4, where Paul uses military imagery to describe the commitment and discipline required for Christian ministry:
2 Timothy 2:3-4 (NIV):
"Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer."
This metaphor emphasizes the dedication and discipline expected from Christians, likening them to soldiers who are focused on their mission and loyalty to their leader, which in this case is Christ Jesus.
