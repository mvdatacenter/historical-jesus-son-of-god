\section{Chapter 4 - Pauline Epistles to All Nations}\label{sec:chapter-4---pauline-epistles-to-all-nations}

πορευθέντες οὖν μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ``Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations.''

The key point missed by most scholars is that \textit{panta ta ethnē} does not refer to ``all nations'' universally, but rather to the nations of the Greek world.
The Septuagint consistently uses \textit{ethnē} to describe the nations under God's rule---those invited into covenant---not every nation globally.
In Hellenistic inscriptions, the phrase ``all the nations'' (\textit{panta ta ethnē}) is repeatedly used to describe the \textit{oikoumene}, the civilized world subject to the emperor.
It was imperial language, not global anthropology.
Thus, Matthew’s Great Commission is not an open-ended call to the Americas or India, but to the Greek-speaking nations of the empire.

Καὶ εὐλογηθήσονται ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς ``And in your seed, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.''
This is a key passage used in early Christianity (Galatians 3:8) to show that all the nations were meant to be part of God's covenant, not just outsiders.

Βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ πάντες λαοὶ, ἄρχοντες καὶ πάντες κριταὶ γῆς\ldots{} ὑψώσεως κεράτων λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὕμνος πᾶσι τοῖς ὁσίοις αὐτοῦ, τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ, λαῷ ἐγγίζοντι αὐτῷ.
``Kings of the earth and all peoples, rulers and all judges of the earth\ldots{} a hymn for all His saints, the sons of Israel, a people near to Him.''
The ``kings of the earth and all peoples'' are brought into God's rule, but the focus remains on God's people.

All nations referred to God's people, not necessarily only Greek ethnicity, but all nations who proclaimed the rule of God.
So that would also include Jews and any other nation integrated into the imperial covenant.

\paragraph{1.
The early dating of the gospels can make the letters of Paul more plausible as it seems Paul already has the knowledge of at least one of the gospels and the acts.}\label{par:the-early-dating-of-the-gospels-can-make-the-letters-of-paul-more-plausible-as-it-seems-paul-already-has-the-knowledge-of-at-least-one-of-the-gospels-and-the-acts.}

Many scholars dispute the existence of Paul based on the striking contradiction in mainstream scholarship that authors of Pauline epistles seem to have the knowledge of the gospels and the acts, and yet the gospels and the acts are unanimously dated to be written after the Pauline epistles.
In here the existence of Paul can once more be reconsidered if we acknowledge the early dating of the gospels and the gospel of John in being written by an eyewitness of Jesus's life.

\paragraph{2.
What is quite striking is that Paul and others write to so many different churches over the short period of time.}\label{par:what-is-quite-striking-is-that-paul-and-others-write-to-so-many-different-churches-over-the-short-period-of-time.}

There is a major challenge for the traditional timeline of the apostles establishing so many churches in such a short period of time.
These churches would have to all be established, grow, keep up to date with the fastly shifting theology, and then do nearly nothing for the next 100 years.
These churches immediately showed up in every single major city in the former Greek empire, and no churches showed up anywhere else.
All of the correspondence and scripture was written in Greek, and no other languages.
It is important to point out that Greek was absolutely not the lingua franca in any part of the Roman empire that was not recently part of the Greek empire.
The lingua franca of the Roman empire was Latin, and that was the only language that was used in the administration and the primary language used by the authors.
If the apostles were to establish churches everywhere in the Roman empire, and not just in the former Greek empire, then we would have had the epistles to the extremely prominent cities of Mediolanum, Lutetia, Aquilea, Lugdunum, Memphis, and Londinium.
The truth is that no matter how we model the growth of the early church, it is not possible to explain the the patterns we observe.
And then for the next 100 years do not add any new churches.

Even more striking is the total absence of Aramaic or Hebrew letters.
If the apostles’ mission were Jewish in nature, at least some correspondence would survive in the languages of Judea.
Instead, all the letters are in Greek, to Greek assemblies, proving that the movement was imperial and Hellenistic at its core.

\paragraph{2a.
Paul’s letters as state correspondence.}\label{par:pauls-letters-as-state-correspondence.}

The epistles resemble circular letters of the Hellenistic and Roman administrations.
They are addressed to \textit{ekklesiai}, the same word used for political assemblies of citizens in Greek cities.
Paul is not writing to small house cults, but to recognized civic assemblies under a higher king.
This gives the Pauline corpus the character of imperial decrees rather than private exhortations.

There were essentially no prominent cities in the former Greek empire that were not mentioned in the Acts and the epistles:

It is important to actually visualize the locations mentioned in the Acts and the epistles to see the striking pattern of the locations mentioned in the Acts and the epistles being the same as the most significant Greek speaking cities.

\end{figure}

For those geographically inclined you can spot the near perfect correlation with the borders of Eastern Roman Empire.
Of note is the trip to Rome, which was substantially different in nature to the other trips.

\paragraph{3.
The striking statistics of the cities mentioned in the Acts and the epistles are that they are all in the former Greek empire, and not one mention of a city in the Roman empire that was not part of the former Greek empire.}\label{par:the-striking-statistics-of-the-cities-mentioned-in-the-acts-and-the-epistles-are-that-they-are-all-in-the-former-greek-empire-and-not-one-mention-of-a-city-in-the-roman-empire-that-was-not-part-of-the-former-greek-empire.}

This fact makes any theory that deems Christianity as a religious and not a political movement immediately highly implausible.

\paragraph{4.
Finally we consider the apparent minimal resistance to the acceptance of the new religion.}\label{par:finally-we-consider-the-apparent-minimal-resistance-to-the-acceptance-of-the-new-religion.}

The new religion was accepted by the masses in the former Greek empire, and not a single mention of any resistance to the new religion from the Greeks themselves.
The only real opposition comes from the Temple authorities in Jerusalem.
This is consistent with Christianity being a continuation of Greek imperial philosophy, which the Hellenized population already accepted.

\paragraph{5.
We should also consider that even though the religion was so successful at converting the masses, it still had all the conspiratorial parts to it.}\label{par:we-should-also-consider-that-even-though-the-religion-was-so-successful-at-converting-the-masses-it-still-had-all-the-conspiratorial-parts-to-it.}

Early Christians used secret symbols to identify each other, they frequently met in secret, often at night in the catacombs.
This is not unlike the initiation practices of other imperial soldier cults such as Mithras.
The Pauline language of ``soldiers of Christ'' fits this conspiratorial military model.

\paragraph{6.
Consider why the religion was seemingly much more prosecuted than any other religion in the Roman empire.}\label{par:consider-why-the-religion-was-seemingly-much-more-prosecuted-than-any-other-religion-in-the-roman-empire.}

The Roman empire was very tolerant of other religions, and the only time they would prosecute a religion was if it was a threat to the empire.
Christians were persecuted not for worshipping a strange god, but for refusing the Roman emperor cult while insisting that only their Christ was king.
This was a political treason, not theological quibbling.

\paragraph{7.
The phrase ``soldiers of Christ'' is not used explicitly in the Gospels, but it appears prominently in the Pauline Epistles.}\label{par:the-phrase-soldiers-of-christ-is-not-used-explicitly-in-the-gospels-but-it-appears-prominently-in-the-pauline-epistles-particularly-in-the-context-of-the-christian-life-being-compared-to-a-military-struggle-or-a-spiritual-battle.}

The metaphor emphasizes loyalty, discipline, and readiness for conflict under a divine king.
It reflects the military cultic environment of the empire, not a rural Jewish sect.

\paragraph{8.
Paul barely mentions the life of Jesus, and almost never quotes him.}\label{par:paul-barely-mentions-the-life-of-jesus-and-almost-never-quotes-him.}

It is frequently claimed that Paul's religion is not the religion of Jesus, but the religion about Jesus.
There is a shocking lack of references to any of the teachings of Jesus, the Jewish law, and any of the events surrounding Jesus's life and death.
So we may go one step further.
It is a religion focusing on restoring the kingdom of God by resurrecting the office of the Christos, the rightful king of the kingdom of God.
And so to Paul and all the early Christians, it was all about resurrecting a Christ, not teachings of the particular Jesus Christ.
The idea that God will once again send a king that will restore the Greek empire, the kingdom of God, headed by Christos, the rightful earthly king of the kingdom of God.

\paragraph{9.
Using this conspiratorial language clearly worked.}\label{par:using-this-conspiratorial-language-clearly-worked}

Rome did not even realize the new religion's goal was to restore the Eastern Empire until it actually happened.

\paragraph{10.
Alexandria was the capital of the Greek Empire and the center of the Hellenistic world and yet there are no missions or letters to Alexandria.}\label{par:alexandria-was-the-capital-of-the-greek-empire-and-the-center-of-the-hellenistic-world-and-yet-there-are-no-missions-or-letters-to-alexandria.}

The absence of Alexandria in the New Testament is striking, especially considering its significance.
Alexandria was erased from the text, as it was the origin city of Apollos, as well as some of the other companions of Paul such as Mark, Demas, and Luke.
The omission is best explained as deliberate suppression, precisely because Alexandria was already the center of the movement.
Just as the Old Testament largely omits the Ptolemaic empire despite its centrality, so the New Testament minimizes Alexandria while still presuming its leadership.

\subsection{Acts of the Apostles}\label{subsec:acts-of-the-apostles}

Is called the Acts of the Apostles, not acts of the disciples.
Apostles doing imperial work of letting all nations of the empire know the will of the God king.

\paragraph{10.
Acts opens with a royal enthronement}\label{par:acts-opens-with-a-royal-enthronement}

Acts 1:6 --- ``Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?'' This is not a spiritual question.
It implies Jesus had a claim to political kingship.
Your theory: Jesus was understood as the rightful monarch of a revived kingdom---a successor to the Herodian or Hasmonean thrones under Greek imperial ideals.

\paragraph{10.
Jesus is taken up like an emperor}\label{par:jesus-is-taken-up-like-an-emperor}

Acts 1:9--11 --- The Ascension mimics apotheosis scenes (e.g., Alexander, Roman emperors).
It frames Jesus in imperial terms, being enthroned in heaven---like a divine emperor.
This matches your view that Christianity was about loyalty to the ``Christ Emperor.''

\paragraph{10.
The Pentecost scene mimics an imperial inauguration}\label{par:the-pentecost-scene-mimics-an-imperial-inauguration}

Acts 2 --- Multilingual miracle and mass conversion reflects the imperial ideal of uniting nations under one divine king.
The language of ``tongues'' is political: the emperor's message is for all nations.

\paragraph{10.
Acts 5: The trial of the apostles}\label{par:acts-5-the-trial-of-the-apostles}

Gamaliel references past revolutionary figures---Theudas and Judas the Galilean.
This acknowledges that messianic revolts were political, and that Jesus' movement was seen in similar terms.

\paragraph{10.
Stephen's speech in Acts 7 is anti-Temple}\label{par:stephens-speech-in-acts-7-is-anti-temple}

Stephen attacks the Temple and Mosaic tradition, echoing Philo and Stoic-influenced criticisms of Jewish legalism.
This supports the view that early Christianity rejected the Mosaic religion and aligned more with philosophical monotheism.

\paragraph{10.
Paul as imperial envoy}\label{par:paul-as-imperial-envoy}

Paul appeals to Caesar, travels through Greek cities, and preaches to Hellenized elites.
His speeches (e.g., Acts 17 in Athens) are clearly political-philosophical, not sectarian Jewish.
Acts frames Paul as a philosopher-diplomat for the Christ-emperor.

\paragraph{11.
Acts ends without resolution}\label{par:acts-ends-without-resolution}

The book ends in Rome, with Paul freely preaching ``the kingdom of God.''
It lacks a narrative climax because its real message is that the empire is now Christian.
It presumes a pre-existing audience that sees Christianity as a political-theological force.

\subsubsection{James the Just}\label{par:james-the-just}

\paragraph{1.
James the Just also wrote an epistle to all nations.}\label{par:james-the-just-also-wrote-an-epistle-to-all-nations.}

He was the brother of Jesus, and the next in line to the throne.
Much like Jesus Christ the Soter, James also held a royal title, the Just.

James the Just also wrote an epistle to all nations, which is included in the New Testament.
James, like John, refers to the same understanding of Logos as Philo of Alexandria.
The writing style of James and John also bears a striking resemblance to the writing style of Philo of Alexandria.

In Greek, James 1:21 reads as:
``Διὸ ἀποθέμενοι πάσαν ἀκαθαρσίαν καὶ περισσείαν κακίας ἐν πραΰτητι δέξασθε τὸν ἐμφυτον λόγον, ὃς δύναται σῶσαι τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν.''
Transliteration: ``Dio apothemenoi pasan akatharsian kai perisseian kakias en prautēti dexasthē ton emphuton logon, hos dynatai sōsai tas psychas hymōn.''
A literal translation: ``Therefore, putting away all filthiness and the overflow of wickedness, with meekness receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.''

It should go without saying that the advanced writing style of James and John is not something that would be expected from a simple fisherman or a son of a carpenter.
Rather, it confirms Alexandrian philosophical schooling at the very center of the Greek imperial world.
