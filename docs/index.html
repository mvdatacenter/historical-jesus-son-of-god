<h2 id="par:preface">Preface</h2>
<p>On 31 Aug the year 326 BCE, Alexander the Great, King of the Macedon
stood on the banks of the river Hydaspes in India and wept because there
were no more worlds to conquer. In the year 323 BCE, Alexander the Great
died in Babylon and left his empire to the strongest among his men. His
empire was divided with the biggest share and the imperial title going
to Seleucus Nicator. Under the greek rule there came an era of
enlightenment and prosperity in all the nations of the world. In a short
span of time countless colonies were founded and given the law, currency
and culture of the Greeks. Of all the cities under the sun, Ephesus,
Antioch, Thessalonica, Laodiciea, Philippi, Corinth, Athens, Tarsus and
Alexandria rose as the greatest seats of learning.</p>
<p>In 146 BCE, the Roman general Lucius Mummius destroyed Corinth, and
Polybius lamented, “The day will come when men will ask where once stood
mighty Corinth.” In the year 85 BCE, to the shock of the world, the
Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla fought and destroyed the combined
350,000 strong army of the Greek would. Athens, once the teacher of the
world, lay in ruins. In 31 BCE, at Actium, fortune truly turned away
from the Greeks and embraced the Romans as Gaius Julius Caesar
Octavianus defeated the combined forces of the Greek world and Mark
Antony. In the East the Greek world was attacked by the Parthians and
Scythians. Meanwhile, in the East, the unstoppable tide of Scythians
pressed upon the remnants of Alexander’s empire. The last Greek king of
Bactria, Strato II Soter, fell to king Rajuvula around 10 CE. With that
the fall of the entire Greek world was no more, well, not exactly… When
the general Sulla sued for peace he did not fully incorporate the Judea,
a rebellious land, and permitted the the Greek dynasties of the
Hasmoneans and Herodians to continue to rule as client kingdoms of
Gallilee, Samaria, Judea, Decapolis. And so the imperial court officials
of the Greeks, the Head of the Imperial Guard, the Keeper of Imperial
Light and the Imperial Treasurer, came to Galilee from the East to seek
the last rightful heir to the empire.</p>
<p>About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to
call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a
teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews
and many of the Greeks. He was the Christ. When Pilate, upon hearing him
accused by men of the highest standing amongst us, had condemned him to
be crucified, those who had in the first place come to love him did not
give up their affection for him. On the third day he appeared to them
restored to life, for the prophets of God had prophesied these and
countless other marvelous things about him. And the tribe of the
Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not
disappeared.</p>
<p>There is a bird which is called the Phoenix. This is the only one of
its kind and lives five hundred years. When the time of its dissolution
draws near, it makes for itself a coffin of frankincense and myrrh and
other spices, and when the time is fulfilled it enters it and dies. But
as its flesh decays, a worm is produced, which is nourished by the
moisture of the dead creature and puts forth wings. Then, when it has
grown strong, it takes up that coffin and flies from the land of Arabia
to Egypt, to the city of Heliopolis, and, in the daytime, in the sight
of all, it places itself on the altar of the sun.</p>
<p>And so dear brothers and sisters in Christ, the Son of God, the King
of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the Savior of the World, the Light of the
World, the Prince of Peace, the Lamb of God, the Good Shepherd, the Way,
the Truth, the Life, the Alpha, the Omega, he died for the sins of
others, and so we should repent and believe the good news, for the
Kingdom of God is at hand, the time is fulfilled, and the purple phoenix
shall rise again.</p>
<p>Mild he lays his glory by, born that man no more may die, born to
raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth. Joyful all ye
nations rise, join the triumph of the skies, with the angelic host
proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem, Hark! the herald angels sing,
glory to the newborn king.</p>

of Joseph and Mary Christ</h1>
<h2
id="sec:chapter-1---jesus-christ-son-of-joseph-and-mary-christ">Chapter
1 - Jesus Christ, Son of Joseph and Mary Christ</h2>
<p>In the first chapter we will list interesting questions regarding the
origins and identity of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>There is a long-standing assumption that historical Jesus and his
apostles and companions were illiterate Jewish peasants from Judea and
Galilee which were a backwater of the Roman empire. This assumption
underlays nearly all of modern scholarship and is treated as gospel
while there is barely any evidence to support it, while there is
overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Breaking this assumption can
categorically change the way we assign the probabilities to various
theories about the life and death of Jesus Christ and the rise of
Christianity.</p>
<h5 id="par:historical-background">0. Historical background</h5>
<p>While this book questions a lot of seemingly core concepts of the
historical Jesus scholarship, the general timeline is assumed to be
correct. All the arguments about time shifts and Jesus living and dying
in even slightly different times are not considered in this book and not
supported by any evidence. The book assumes the historical timeline in
the gospel of Matthew is correct and that Jesus was born in 4 BC and
died in 33 AD . Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and did flee to Alexandria,
Egypt, as an infant and spent a meaningful part of his childhood there.
Later in life he moved to Galilee, although the exact time of the move
is not known. It could have been at 2 years old, but also at 12 years
old.</p>

One of the most ridiculed but still very interesting questions is
whether Jesus Christ could actually be the son of Joseph and Mary Christ
and not a Jewish Messiah.</h5>
<p>Mixing up the term Christos and Messiah is very deeply rooted in
historiography of Jesus. Nearly every historical treatment of the topic
forgets that Christos is a Greek term for the chosen one, or a royal
figure and Messiah is a Jewish term for a prophesized apocalyptic
figure. The term Christos is almost exclusively used throughout the new
testament whereas the term Messiah is used only a couple of times in
encounters with Jewish figures. As such, the term Messiah seems to only
be used to convince specific Jewish people that Jesus Christos is also a
Jewish Messiah and not only the Greek Christos.</p>
<h5
id="par:jesus-could-have-become-a-christos-because-he-had-a-royal-lineage-through-his-mother-mary-christ.">2.
Jesus could have become a Christos because he had a royal lineage
through his mother Mary Christ.</h5>
<p>The lineage of Jesus is described in the gospels of Matthew and Luke,
and with the Luke gospel traditionally linking the lineage of Jesus
through his mother Mary. From that alone we know that both Mary and
Joseph were also considered to be of royal lineage. This topic has been
very deeply discussed by James Tabor in his book “The Jesus Dynasty”,
and for an even longer expanded list of arguments and more in depth
discussion as to why Jesus descended from the Hasmonean dynasty, please
refer to the book.</p>
<h5
id="par:jesuss-mother-was-mary-christ-the-last-rightful-heiress-to-the-hasmonean-dynasty.">3.
Jesus’s mother was Mary Christ, the last rightful heiress to the
Hasmonean dynasty.</h5>
<p>Marry’s life was described in the Protoevangelium of James, which was
considered a very reliable source by the early church fathers. Details
of the Protoevangelium of James were also confirmed by the Jewish
philosopher Celsus, who lived in the 2nd century AD, and was a very
prominent critic of Christianity. The protoevangelium of James lists the
father of Mary as Joachim with is in agreement with the gospel of Luke,
which lists the father of Mary as Heli, a short form of Eliakim, which
the same name as Joachim. Describing Mary as a perpetual virgin and the
conception of Jesus as immaculate, is in agreement with the sources on
Greek princesses. Making her a Christ, the rightful ruler of the
Hasmonean dynasty would explain why there her story was recorded in this
scribal biographical fashion. Mary’s brother was Simon, who was the high
priest of the temple in Jerusalem, and was killed by Herod the Great in
23 BC . Mary’s birth name was Miriam, which was a very common name in
the Hasmonean dynasty. Mary’s birthplace was Sepphoris. In 104 BC
Alexander Jannaeus of the Hasmonean dynasty conquered Sepphoris and made
it his capital. Jannaeus is a very rare name and also mentioned in the
lineage of Mary in the Luke gospel.</p>
<h5
id="par:joseph-was-marys-second-husband-and-a-widower-as-pantera-was-killed-by-herod-the-great-soon-after-jesus-was-conceived.">4.
Joseph was Mary’s second husband and a widower, as Pantera was killed by
Herod the Great soon after Jesus was conceived.</h5>
<p>Celsus, a very well-educated prominent philosopher, who used the name
Panthera as one of the main arguments against the divinity of Jesus,
must have had a very solid source to make such a claim, otherwise, it
would carry absolutely no impact. Shabbat 104b &amp; Tosefta Hullin 2:22
– Contains indirect references to Jesus and Mary (Miriam), implying she
was accused of adultery.</p>
<p>We need to note here that the name of Herod’s firstborn son was
Antipater, not Pantera. However, the name Antipater is already an
english version of name Ἀντίπατρος. This name is not pronounceable in
natural Hebrew which lacks the “nt” consonant cluster and in Hebrew
names are frequently shortened. Notably, Alexander (Alexandros) was
commonly called Sandros, Sendros, Sanra And the nt cluster was dropped
in Antiochus which was often referred to as Yochus or Yuki (in some
Jewish traditions) and Antipas who was called Pas or Pasi (later
Talmudic contractions) Finally πατρος morphing back to Pantera as it
passed from greek to hebrew and back to greek due to the propensity of
the Hebrew language to drop and add single letters.</p>
<h5
id="par:jesus-was-born-in-bethlehem-the-city-of-the-hasmonean-dynasty-and-the-birthplace-of-the-christs.">5.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the city of the Hasmonean dynasty and the
birthplace of the Christs.</h5>
<h5

Jesus fleeing to Egypt can be a historical fact as the Hasmonean family
had very close ties to Egypt.</h5>
<p>Notably according to Luke genealogy, Jesus’s great-great-great
grandfather was Alexander Jannaeus, who was a very prominent figure in
the Hasmonean dynasty. The son of Jannaeus, Aristobulus II had a
daughter Alexandra, married Philippion, a member of the Ptolemaic
dynasty. It is also highly</p>

<p>Sanhedrin 67a – Mentions a figure called Ben Stada, who was accused
of sorcery and brought from Egypt. Some later traditions tried to
connect this figure to Jesus, but the identification is debated.</p>
<h5
id="par:herod-dies-in-10ad-not-4bc-and-the-gospels-of-matthew-and-luke-are-not-in-agreement-on-the-date-of-jesuss-birth.">8.
Herod dies in 10AD, not 4BC, and the gospels of Matthew and Luke are not
in agreement on the date of Jesus’s birth.</h5>
<p>There is a small difficulty in dating the Jesus birth to 7BC, common
date used in modern scholarship.</p>
<p>There is an apparent contradiction between the gospels of Matthew and
Luke, as the gospel of Matthew states that Jesus was born during the
reign of Herod the Great, who died in 4BC, while the gospel of Luke
states that Jesus was born during the reign of Quirinius, who was
governor of Syria from 6AD to 12AD .</p>
<p>Even if we date the gospels very late to late second century, it is
still hard to explain how the authors could be so right about so many
historical background details, yet so wrong about such a critical part
of the story. Other than birth, Luke would have to be wrong about Jesus
age at the time of baptism, which is also a very critical part of the
story. Adding to this, in this book we have a further discrepancy of
Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar journey in 7BC would make no sense as
the Greek throne was still held by Strato III and this kingdom was not
at the brink of collapse just yet.</p>
<p>It is very overstated what we really know historically about this
date. We know the Quirinius was governor of Syria from 6AD to 12AD . It
is worth emphasizing that Quirinius being a governor of Syria does not
imply Judea was annexed the second day he came to power. It does not
violate any historical records to assume Judea was annexed just before
he left the office in 12AD . We know the census happened during his
governorship, but we do not know when exactly. Josephus does not claim
the census occurred after the death of Herod the Great. We know Josephus
placed the death of Herod the Great at the lunar eclipse just before the
Passover. Note that he specifically emphasized he died after a long
illness, which is consistent with the fact he may have spent a few years
with the power shifted to his son Archelaus.</p>
<p>And here already comes a substantial mainstream scholarship error.
The passage from Josephus that is used to date the death of Herod the
Great states “the eclipse of the moon, which happened before his death,
took place on the 10th day of the month Lous, which is Nisan.” What is
not admitted is that there were 51 lunar eclipses in the years 7BC to
12AD . Out of these, there were three that happened at nighttime in
Nisan and would have been prominent enough to be seen by the people. The
scholarly consensus is that this passage refers to the lunar eclipse of
4BC, however, upon closer inspection, in 4BC the lunar eclipse happened
in Adar, a whole month earlier.</p>
<p>The only possible dates for the lunar eclipse that happened close to
10 Nisan between 4pm UTC and 4am UTC, so could have been seen by the
people in Jerusalem is: 0012 Apr 24–22:38:24 10410 -24585 41 N -a 1.4693
0.1335 -0.8101 96.4 - - 11S 64E</p>
<p>Notably the lunar eclipse always happens at full moon and the 15
Nisan is the full moon of the month of Nisan. However, as the lunar
calendars do not align with solar, Jewish calendars introduce a second
month of Adar, immediately before Nisan on leap years. And it so happens
that in year 12AD, the extra month of Adar moved the 15th of Nisan a few
days later, which explains why Josephus would have said the lunar
eclipse happened on the 10th of Nisan. While on all other possible dates
the lunar eclipse happened within a day of the 15th of Nisan.</p>
<p>This readjustment actually solves a lot of problems with the dating
of Jesus’s birth and the census. And then the gospels would be in
perfect agreement with each other. Quirinius may have conducted his
census in 6AD, Jesus could have been both in 6AD . There was enough time
to spend some time in Jerusalem in the first 2 years of Jesus’s life,
visiting the temple and being circumcised. The magi could have come to
visit him in 8AD when he was a very young child, right at the time of
the fall of Greco-Indian kingdom. Herod would have the time to order the
slaughter of the innocents in 8AD, and Jesus could have fled to Egypt
staying there for the next 4 years. And then settling in Nazareth once
Herod Antipas took over the throne of Judea.</p>
<p>With this new dating, there come some apparent contradictions with
the records. Most notably the traditional dating of the reign of Herod
Archelaus, who was the son of Herod the Great and was the ruler of Judea
from 4BC to 6AD . Do note that Herod the Great was a tetrarch of Judea
and not a king, and the title subsumed Judea proper Galilee Perea Idumea
Samaria And other parts adjacent to Nabataea and the Decapolis.</p>
<p>At that time Archelaus was given the title of ethnarch, which was
only a king of the Jews. Josephus also quite clearly states that
Archelaus ruled while Herod the Great was still alive.</p>
<p>Heir Territory Title Archelaus Judea, Samaria, Idumea Ethnarch (not
King) Herod Antipas Galilee, Perea Tetrarch Philip Gaulanitis, Batanea,
Trachonitis, Iturea Tetrarch</p>
<p>It is also important to highlight the tenures of the Roman governors
of Judea is also actually tied to the reign of Herod Archelaus and the
know dates are not attested from other sources. So if the reign of Herod
Archelaus ended in 12AD, there is still plenty of time to plausibly fit
Coponius, Ambivulus, Annius Rufus and Valerius Gratus, the predecessors
of Pontius Pilate, into the timeline.</p>

As Jesus grew up, he was heavily involved in the reconstruction of
Nazareth and the surrounding areas which was destroyed by the Roman
army.</h5>
<p>Hence, the gospels call him tecton, which was misleadingly later
translated as carpenter.</p>
<h5

As with his royal lineage Jesus was also exposed to a variety of
scripture and was highly educated.</h5>
<p>The later connections of Jesus parables to many thoughts and
principles of the Greek philosophers, especially the stoics, must imply
Jesus was highly educated in the Greek way of life.</p>

Jesus was very close to and heavily influenced by his cousin John the
Baptist, who christened Jesus and declared him a Christ, the rightful
ruler of a Greek kingdom.</h5>
<p>John mentions that he was not worthy to untie the sandals of Jesus,
which was a common Greek expression for a disciple. The gospel of John
also mentions that Jesus was the lamb of God</p>

Under the influence of his mother Mary, Jesus was still a believer in
the Greek way of life and always taught others the teachings of the
Greek philosophers.</h5>
<p>The philosopher king was a very common concept in the Greek world,
and Jesus was educated to become a true philosopher king. He learned
from the stoics, the cynics, and the epicureans, and his teachings were
heavily influenced by them. Do onto others as you would have them do
onto you, is a very common stoic principle.</p>

The first historical mention of Jesus is in the writings of Mar Bar
Serapion, a stoic philosopher, who wrote a letter to his son from
prison.</h5>
<p>The testimony of Serapion of Syria is a very important piece of
evidence for the existence of Jesus. The testimony from 73AD reads:
“What advantage did the Athenians gain from putting Socrates to death?
Famine and plague came upon them as a judgment for their crime. Or the
people of Samos for burning Pythagoras? In one moment their country was
covered by sand. Or the Jews by murdering their wise king? After that
their kingdom was abolished.”</p>
<h5
id="par:testimonium-flavianum---josephus-a-jewish-historian-mentions-jesus-in-his-antiquities">16.
Testimonium Flavianum - Josephus, a Jewish historian, mentions Jesus in
his Antiquities</h5>
<p>Jesper Flavius, a Jewish historian, mentions Jesus in his
Antiquities, which was written in 93 AD . The passage reads: “At this
time there appeared Jesus, a wise man. For he was a doer of startling
deeds, a teacher of people who receive the truth with pleasure. And he
gained a following both among many Jews and among the Greeks. He was the
Christ.” This passage has been heavily debated by scholars, but the
evidence for its authenticity is very strong. The question is why would
a Jewish historian known to have no sympathy for Christianity call Jesus
a Christ? The only plausible explanation is that he was a Christ, a
rightful heir to the Greek empire, and not a Jewish Messiah.</p>
<p>This passage poses a very strong conundrum for the scholars who
believe that Jesus was a Jewish Messiah and not a Greek Christ. The
typical explanation is that the passage was interpolated by later
Christian scribes is not supported by evidence and would require an
extraordinary high level of conspiracy.</p>
<p>The conundrum is further deepened by the fact that in another passage
that is also considered authentic by the scholars and much less likely
to be an interpolation, Josephus mentions that Jesus the Christ was the
brother of James, who was the high priest of the temple in
Jerusalem.</p>
<h5
id="par:cornelius-tacitus-a-one-of-the-most-prominent-roman-historians-mentions-jesus-in-his-annals-which-was-written-in-116-ad.">17.
Cornelius Tacitus, a one of the most prominent Roman historians,
mentions Jesus in his Annals, which was written in 116 AD.</h5>
<p>The passage reads: “The founder of this name, Christ, was put to
death by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius.”
The overwhelming majority of scholars consider this passage to be
authentic, and evidence against a possible interpolation is very strong.
This is both because of the style of writing and the difficulty of the
passage to be interpolated given the high popularity and importance of
his works. A single church father would have had a very hard time to
interpolate such a wide-spead work. Given how skilled Tacitus was at
historical writing it is an extraordinary corroborating evidence for
Jesus being a Christ.</p>
<p>It is thus very compelling that the three earliest mentions of Jesus
are from a stoic philosopher, a Jewish historian, both of whom had no
reason to lie about Jesus’s identity and all of whom are know not to
believe in Jesus’s divinity clearly state that Jesus was a Christ and a
king of the Jews.</p>

Pliny the Younger, a Roman governor, mentions Jesus in his letters to
the emperor Trajan, which were written in 112 AD.</h5>
<p>The passage reads: “But they asserted that the sum and substance of
their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a
fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a
god.” The authenticity of this letter is sometimes debated, but
regardless of its authenticity, it highlights the fact that what was
known about Jesus was that he was a Christ. So even though this passage
adds little to the historical evidence of existence of Jesus, it does
add to the evidence that Jesus was a Christ. Note that once again, it is
not Jesus the wise man or Jesus of Nazareth, but Jesus the Christ.</p>

<p>The part of the passage reads “and they worship the same crucified
sophist and live after his laws.” In here Jesus is called a sophist,
which was a common term for a philosopher in the Greek world.</p>
<p>This passage is much later, but highlights the fact that Jesus was
considered a philosopher by the Greeks which would corroborate Jesus’s
noble Greek lineage. Again, we are talking about cultural ties here,
someone who was closely related to and promoting Greek culture.</p>
<h5 id="par:clark-kent-argument">21. Clark Kent argument</h5>
<p>There is something to be said about the fact of the wealth of
historical records surrounding Jesus Christ and his apostles. “In total,
we have 42 sources dating to less than 150 years after Jesus’s death
that mention his existence, 9 of which are non-Christian. In comparison,
regarding Julius Caesar, only five sources report his military
operations.”</p>
<p>The argument goes that if Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, or just
a wise man, why would there be so many sources mentioning him? There
were no books about Clark Kent, but there are many about Superman. For
this argument we have to consider both independent sources and the
sources that are not Christian.</p>
<p>The wealth of the available records can would be hard to explain by
Jesus without supernatural powers or not being a very prominent
political figure of major significance. In fact the only
non-supernatural plausible explanation may be that Christianity was a
loyalist movement attempting to restore the Greek empire.</p>
<h5 id="par:ossuary-of-james">22. Ossuary of James</h5>
<p>The James Ossuary, which reads “James son of Joseph, brother of
Jesus,” has long been the subject of authenticity debates. However, when
examined in the context of the Talpiot Tomb, it becomes a strong data
point for Jesus having been a historical figure of high lineage — not a
legendary peasant.</p>
<p>Over 1,000 ossuaries have been excavated from the Jerusalem area,
dated within a few decades of Jesus’s death. The practice of bone
collection into ossuaries was limited primarily to urban, upper-class
Jewish families due to cost and ritual precision. Most ossuaries found
have no inscriptions — only a minority were inscribed, and among those,
only prominent individuals typically had names written.</p>
<p>Critics of the Talpiot Tomb theory have claimed that the names found
— Yeshua (Jesus), Yosef (Joseph, father of Jesus), Maria (Mary), Yose (a
diminutive of Joseph), Matya (Matthew), Yehuda bar Yeshua (Judas son of
Jesus), and Mariamne — were all common in 1st-century Judea. And the
critics are right to question all published statistical analyses as they
are full of statistical and logical errors that critics very rightfully
point out. Almost all the analysis already fail on even asking the right
questions to judge the authenticity of the tomb. The right question to
ask is what is the probability that this specific tomb could have
existed at that time with these specific names in it and not be related
to Jesus. P(this tomb exists not-Jesus) — the probability this cluster
arises in a non-Jesus family tomb, purely by chance.</p>
<p>Here we will re-do the analysis correctly and using the priors of the
theory that Jesus and his family were a prominent family deserving an
inscription on their ossuaries.</p>
<p>But this objection fails to consider two key statistical
distortions:</p>
<p>Only a small fraction of ossuaries has inscriptions, and the more
elite the individual, the more likely the ossuary was inscribed. This
filters the name sample to a specific social class, not the general
population. Only one other known ossuary inscription among over 1,000
ever includes the phrase “brother of” — a highly unusual addition. The
James Ossuary is the only one pairing “brother of” with names that
correspond precisely to the Jesus of the Gospels. This feature alone
radically shifts the statistical significance: the rarity of “brother
of” in ossuary inscriptions is what transforms this find from
coincidental to highly suggestive. Furthermore, geochemical analysis has
shown that the patina of the James Ossuary matches that of the ossuaries
in the Talpiot tomb, suggesting it was originally part of the same tomb.
If so, then the presence of a “James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus”
ossuary from that family tomb further increases the probability that
this is indeed the burial site of the historical Jesus and his immediate
family.</p>
<p>This convergence of:</p>
<p>Rare inscription format, Clustered familial names, Matching
archaeological context, And elite-class burial indicators …invalidates
assumptions of random name coincidence and suggests high plausibility
that we are looking at a dynastic burial, not a later legend.</p>
<p>Mariamnou is a fairly uncommon variant of the name Mary but held by
Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>Some experts claim the change of these names with familial
connections is 1 in a few hundred. That is simply very poor math skills
of the mainstream scholars that everyone repeats and nobody
mathematically oriented bothers to check. We know the change of Mary is
about 25%, and the change of Joseph is about 10%, Jesus is about 1.5%,
Jehuda is about 1.5%, and the change of James is about 1.5%.</p>
<p>So when we combine the odds of Jesus son of Joseph, brother of James,
two Marys with a Mariamnou variant.</p>
<p>Very notably this is a greek variant of the name Mary and that is
because as a Herodian court member Mary Magdalene would have been a
Greek speaker or at least very heavy hellenized. Finding that name in a
tomb in Jerusalem would likely not be even close to 0.01, but for this
analysis we will assume it is 0.01.</p>
<p>The way to do the math correctly is to estimate how many tombs with
inscribed ossuaries were there in Jerusalem around the time of
Jesus.</p>
<p>We can estimate around 1000 tombs, and generously 200 tombs with
inscribed ossuaries.</p>
<p>The Talpiot tomb had 6 inscribed ossuaries, we add James ossuary to
it as it was a chemical match.</p>
<p>We have no record of Juda son of Jesus, and Mathew so we treat them
as random names, plausibly close family members that we cannot assign
with much probability to any particular person in any text or
tradition.</p>
<p>The statistical question is what is the probability of finding these
5 names within a tomb of 7 people given the number of tombs being
200.</p>
<p>P(Jesus,Joseph,Jacob,Mary,Mariamnou in a group of
7)=0.015×0.10×0.015×0.25×0.01 * 21, In 200 tombs this gives us
0.00023625</p>
<p>Now from here, we need to account for Jesus and Jacob being sons of
Joseph and Jesus brother of James. Given 3 known male names that are
very likely to be brothers or sons of each other, that gives us a factor
of 1 in 7. So interesting the strongest arguments given for the strength
of the statistics which is brother-father relations only give a
relatively minor boost to the probability. And even more interestingly,
Jesus listed brother of James is thought to be a major factor in the
probability of the ossuary being authentic, but actually it does not
even change the probability calculation at all. Both Jesus and James are
marked sons of Joseph already, so knowing Jesus and James being brother
is already fully accounted for.</p>
<p>But now finally out of 1000 inscribed ossuaries we have only one case
of brother of, so having the brother of Jesus is 1 in 1000.</p>
<p>That leaves us with a staggering 3.375e-8 probability. However, we
cannot stop here. We need to consider the fact we would have also been
stunned if we found another combination of 5 names.</p>
<p>So for that Jesus and Mary are pretty much required, but the other
three people could plausibly be Joanna, Suzanna, Salome, Martha (other
women mentioned in the gospels, could be romantic interests, but also
sisters), Simon, Judas (Thaddeus), John the Beloved disciple, Joseph the
father of Jesus</p>
<p>Overall we should estimate about up to 10 people filling up the other
two names, albeit with some adjustment because Juda Thaddeus and Suzanna
are not as closely tied to Jesus as James and Mary Magdalene. For that
we account for about 30 or so plausible combinations of people we would
have plausibly identified as Jesus family members.</p>
<p>There is one caveat that Jose in the tomb is Joseph the brother of
Jesus, and not Joseph the father of Jesus. Hence, it is referred to by a
slightly different name variant than Joseph the father of Jesus.</p>
<p>Note that although Joseph the father may actually not be in the
ossuary in favor od the brother, he still needs to enter the statistics
in a similar factor as Joseph the father is clearly inscribed as the
father of Jesus and James.</p>
<p>Joseph in the tomb bing the father of Jesus is actually the
statistically much more probable case, and so for the authenticity
calculation we only need to consider that case (Joseph the father of
Jesus makes this one in a million as this accident being possible to
occur, Joesph the brother of Jesus makes this less than one in 10
million chance).</p>
<p>And that gives us almost exactly one in a million chance a tomb
exited with names and relations we would be leaning to identify as Jesus
family. This is close to 5 sigma which is considered very strong
evidence in natural sciences.</p>
<p>Finally, in a bayesian sense to answer if this tomb is authentic this
needs to be adjusted with a prior of Jesus and some of his family having
a tomb in Jerusalem. In the scenario of this book, this is a very likely
scenario, close to one, but of course if we assign a large probability
to Jesus was only a preacher or Jesus really ascending bodily to heaven,
then the probability of this tomb being authentic will need to get
adjusted by that factor.</p>

δεσπόσυνοι</h5>
<p>Although it is said Jesus never had a son Yehuda, that is necessarily
true.</p>
<p>The blood relatives of Jesus or δεσπόσυνοι are mentioned by
Hegesippus, a prominent early Christian historian were brought to the
attention of the Roman emperor Domitian.</p>
<p>The people brought forward to the emperor were the descendents of
Jude, not Jesus, not James. So although Jude is not directly identified
as a son of Jesus, there is a possibility the Jude discussed by
Hegesippus was a son of Jesus, not Jesus’s brother.</p>
<p>Note that James, Simon and Jude, sons of Joesph, are mentioned in the
gospels as brothers of Jesus, but likely sons of Joseph, from a previous
marriage, while Joseph was likely only an adoptive father of Jesus, not
a biological father.</p>
<p>Hence, δεσπόσυνοι could likely not refer to the brother of Jude, but
instead Jesus’s son, who was also named Jude.</p>
<p>Regardless of if Jude was the son or brother or step-brother, Why
would the emperor be interested in the blood relatives of Jesus if Jesus
did not have a royal lineage?</p>
<h1 id="ch:he-truly-was-the-son-of-god">He Truly was the Son of God</h1>
<h2 id="sec:chapter-2---he-truly-was-the-son-of-god">Chapter 2 - He
Truly was the Son of God</h2>
<p>Next we re-investigate Jesus’s royal claim within the context of the
greek empire. We want to show that all the titles given to Jesus were
titles given to the rulers of the greek empire. That the events
surrounding Jesus’s life were consistent with the events surrounding the
rulers of the greek empire and were deeply rooted in greek imperial
cult.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-christ.">0. Jesus is the Christ.</h5>
<p>In the gospels and all the earliest materials we can see by far the
most common title given to Jesus is Christ. It is not the Messiah, but
the Christ. In the very few cases the word Messiah is used, the gospels
clearly state that Messiah is the Hebrew translation of the word Christ.
Christ is the title used by Josephus, Christ is used by Pliny the
Younger, Christ is used by Tacitus, Christ is used by Suetonius, Christ
is used by Paul. Christ is the only term used by Jesus own highly
educated, greek speaking brother James. It is not the other way around,
Jesus was not actually called the Messiah, which later morphed into
Christ. The gospels just use the Messiah to explain to the Hebrews what
the Christ was, not the other way around. We should look at the usage of
the word Christ in the context of the greek empire and not purely in the
context of the Hebrew apocalyptic literature.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-son-of-god.">1. Jesus is the Son of God.</h5>
<p>Alexander was the son of God and so were the Seleucids, Ptolemys. The
title was used for the rulers of the greek empire.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-son-of-father.">2. Jesus is the Son Of
Father.</h5>
<p>The well known ruler of Egypt, Cleopatra, was given the title “father
loving goddess”. Seleucus IV Philopator was also given the title “father
loving god”. This or similar title was used by countless other rulers in
the greek world. In this context the multiple references to being the
only-begotten son of the father signify the rightful heir, and the only
rightful claim to the throne.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-logos-the-word-of-god.">3. Jesus is the Logos,
the Word of God.</h5>
<p>The Stoics, particularly Zeno of Citium (c. 334–262 BCE) and later
Chrysippus, played a significant role in further developing the idea of
Logos. In Stoic thought, Logos became the rational principle that
permeates and organizes the cosmos. It was understood as a divine
rationality that was present in the universe, giving it structure and
coherence. Very notably, Philo of Alexandria who was closely related to
the Herodian and Hasmonean dynasties and contemporary to Jesus,
described the Logos as a mediator between God and the world. Thus, if
Jesus and some of the other members of the court were indeed visiting
Alexandria in Jesus’s youth, they must have had close exposure to the
idea of logos. Based on the age difference and the family relations,
Jesus would have likely treated Philo as his distinguished uncle, and so
would John the Evangelist.</p>
<p>Notably in the context of the greek empire, the Logos was a divine
principle that was both God’s expression and as such the ruler would
have been considered to speak the Logos of the God. This is consistent
with the idea of multiple quotes as nobody can get to the father except
through me.</p>
<p>Notably Philo described the Logos as the firstborn son of God, and so
the rightful heir to the throne and the intermediary between God and the
world.</p>
<p>Even though countless philosophers claimed rulers should follow the
Logos and called the Logos the divine, the title of the Logos itself
does not appear to have been given to any ruler prior to John’s gospel.
And as the idea of Logos in John appears so closely to the evolution of
the Logos idea from Philo, it increases the likelihood that indeed John
was in a close contact with Philo.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-god-manifested-in-the-flesh.">3. Jesus is the
God manifested in the flesh.</h5>
<p>Epiphanes is a title given to multiple rulers, such as Antiochus IV
and Ptolemy V . The title signify the ruler is the god manifested in the
flesh.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-savior-of-the-world.">4. Jesus is the Savior of
the World.</h5>
<p>Essentially every other ruler of the greek empire was given Soter as
a title, which means savior. The first Ptolemy was given the title
“Soter”, and so was the last king of the greek kingdom Strato II Soter.
Antiochus III was even given the title “The God the Savior”.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-good-shepherd.">5. Jesus is the Good
Shepherd.</h5>
<p>Plato taught that a true philosopher king is a good shepherd. Likely
it stuck as a title for Jesus.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-light-of-the-world.">6. Jesus is the Light of
the World.</h5>
<p>Here the title relates to the cave from Plato’s Republic. The journey
from darkness to light symbolizes the philosopher’s ascent from
ignorance to knowledge, particularly knowledge of the Good.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-king-of-kings-and-lord-of-lords.">7. Jesus is
the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</h5>
<p>Similarly, King of Kings and Lord of Lords was a title used for the
rulers of empires, not only greeks, but also of India and Persia.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-prince-of-peace.">8. Jesus is the Prince of
Peace.</h5>
<p>Ptolemy V Epiphanes famous of the Rosetta stone, was called the
bringer of peace.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-the-word.">9. Jesus is the Word.</h5>
<p>The Stoics, particularly Zeno of Citium (c. 334–262 BCE) and later
Chrysippus, played a significant role in further developing the idea of
Logos. In Stoic thought, Logos became the rational principle that
permeates and organizes the cosmos. It was understood as a divine
rationality that was present in the universe, giving it structure and
coherence. The Stoics taught that humans should live in accordance with
the Logos, which represented divine reason and the natural law of the
universe. For the Stoics, the Logos was both immanent and cosmic,
meaning it was part of everything and governed all things.</p>
<p>For Philo, the Logos was a mediator between God and the world. He
described the Logos as a divine principle that was both God’s expression
and the agent of creation. Philo’s Logos was similar to the Stoic idea,
but with a more direct connection to the Jewish monotheistic
tradition.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-has-12-apostles.">10. Jesus has 12 apostles.</h5>
<p>Apostles were a common term for the emissaries of the greek empire.
Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kings often sent out ἀπόστολοι as official
emissaries or envoys on diplomatic missions. The emissaries represented
the kings’ political will and spread decrees across the empire.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-was-crucified-for-being-the-king-of-the-jews">11.
Jesus was crucified for being the King of The Jews</h5>
<p>This is the actual question that was asked to Jesus by the Roman
governor Pontius Pilate. If Jesus really had the title of the last
rightful heir to the greek empire, then he would have indeed posed a
threat to the Roman empire. Generally apocalyptic preachers would not
have been given this punishment, but a rightful heir to the greek empire
would have been. Typically, the punishment was reserved for those who
posed a threat to the Roman empire.</p>
<h5 id="par:the-writing-on-the-cross-was-the-king-of-the-jews">12. The
writing on the cross was “The King of the Jews”</h5>
<p>In the context of crucifixion being a punishment for those who posed
a threat to the Roman empire, it would make sense that Romans would post
a note like this not to mock Jesus, but to warn others against rebelling
against the Roman empire.</p>
<h5
id="par:jesus-was-not-left-on-the-cross-to-be-eaten-by-scavengers.">13.
Jesus was not left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers.</h5>
<p>Typically, the bodies of the crucified were left on the cross to be
eaten by scavengers, but Jesus was taken down from the cross and buried
in a tomb. This is consistent with the Roman being harsh but ultimately
not trying to overstep their bounds. In a case of a slave committing a
crime, Jesus would be left on the cross, but as they could expect more
rebellion if their cruelty had no bounds, it is conceivable that they
would have allowed Jesus to be buried.</p>
<h5 id="par:parables-of-jesus.">13. Parables of Jesus.</h5>
<p>There are many parables of Jesus that seem to hint at him being a
good ambassador of a future kingdom. The parable of the talents, the
parable of the sower, the parable of the lost sheep, the parable of the
prodigal son, the parable of the good samaritan, the parable of the
wedding feast, the parable of the ten virgins, the parable of the wise
and foolish builders, the parable of the rich fool, the parable of the
barren fig tree, the parable of the great banquet, the parable of the
mustard seed, the parable of the yeast, the parable of the hidden
treasure, the parable of the pearl, the parable of the net, all seem to
hint at a future kingdom that Jesus would rule over.</p>
<h4
id="subsubsec:kingdom-of-god-was-a-common-term-for-the-greek-empire-and-the-greek-kingdoms.">14.
Kingdom of God was a common term for the greek empire and the greek
kingdoms.</h4>
<p>The Hellenistic rulers weren’t just kings—they were divine monarchs
ruling by the will of the gods. Βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ is a very common pre
christian greek term to describe greek kingdoms, notably used in the
writings of Philo of Alexandria who likely influenced Jesus and early
Christian writers. This culture was very deeply rooted in the Greek,
Persian and Egyptian royal cultures for centuries by that time. And so
restoring a kingdom of God on earth much more likely refers to restoring
the greek empire than to some abstract idea of a spiritual kingdom. This
is something fresh in the mind of Philo and Jesus himself.</p>
<h4
id="subsubsec:jesus-birth-was-represented-as-a-new-star-in-the-sky.">15.
Jesus birth was represented as a new star in the sky.</h4>
<p>This is a common trope in the greek world, notably used for the birth
of Alexander the Great. The Ptolemies of Egypt (Greek rulers after
Alexander) often linked their divine status to stars and celestial
phenomena. Ptolemy III (246–222 BC) was honored with a new star
appearing, supposedly confirming his divine favor. The tradition
actually was transferred to the Roman empire, where the birth of
Augustus was also represented as a new star in the sky, and so was the
death and deification of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>The story of Ptolemy III (246–222 BC) and a celestial sign is linked
to the Canopus Decree (238 BC), an inscription issued by Egyptian
priests during his reign. This decree honors Ptolemy III and his wife,
Berenice II, and includes references to astronomical phenomena
associated with his rule.</p>
<p>The Canopus Decree (238 BC) This decree was issued by Egyptian
priests to honor Ptolemy III for his military campaigns and religious
patronage. It mentions a new star appearing in the sky, likely in
connection with his divine status. The decree also orders the addition
of a leap day to the Egyptian calendar, demonstrating Ptolemy III’s
association with astronomical knowledge. Callimachus (Greek Poet, 3rd
Century BC) In his lost work, Aetia, Callimachus possibly referenced
Berenice’s Lock, a constellation myth that was linked to a celestial
omen for Ptolemy III . The myth suggests that Berenice II dedicated a
lock of her hair for her husband’s victory, which disappeared and was
later seen as a new star in the sky (Coma Berenices). Manetho (Egyptian
Historian, 3rd Century BC) Though most of Manetho’s works are lost,
later writers reference his accounts of omens, stars, and divine
portents during the reign of Ptolemy III .</p>
<p>Antiochus III (the Great, r. 222–187 BC) was said to have had a new
star appear before his greatest campaigns. Seleucid coins often depicted
Zeus with a star, symbolizing divine rule.</p>
<p>Mithridates VI of Pontus (120–63 BC) Celestial Sign: A comet appeared
at his birth, interpreted as a sign of his future greatness. Source:
Justin’s Epitome of Pompeius Trogus mentions his divine status.</p>
<h4 id="subsubsec:jesus-was-buried-in-a-tomb.">16. Jesus was buried in a
tomb.</h4>
<p>No other crucified person was buried in a tomb. They were left on the
cross to be eaten by scavengers. A regular revolutionary would have been
left on the cross, but someone with a royal lineage could be given an
extraordinary exception. As the Romans likely could have conceived of
Jesus being more divine by his royal lineage, they may have already be
afraid of Gods wrath at the time of crucifixion.</p>
<h4 id="subsubsec:jesus-was-crucified-on-wednesday-in-31-ad.">17. Jesus
was crucified on Wednesday in 31 AD.</h4>
<p>It is commonly believed that Jesus was crucified on Friday, but all
the Christian sources actually very directly say that Jesus was
crucified on Wednesday. This is not a new idea, but for some unknown
reason it is ignored by nearly all scholars. The Friday crucifixion is a
later liturgical development and not present in the bible or earliest
Christian sources. All gospels agree that Jesus was crucified on the day
of preparation for the Passover. The common misunderstanding is that the
day of preparation is the day before the Sabbath, which is Saturday, but
in this context the passover is also a Sabbath. So for the texts to be
consistent, the day of preparation must be Thursday. If we assume Friday
we have trials before Annas, Caiaphas, Sanhedrin, Herod, and Pilate,
mocking, beatings, travel, flogging, crucifixion, death, burial before
sunset all supposedly occurred on the same morning, which is highly
implausible. There is obviously the extremely common statement that
Jesus was in the tomb for three days and three nights which only works
if we assume Jesus was crucified on Thursday.</p>
<p>To summarize: Wednesday crucifixion in 34 AD (April 21 Julian) fits
all the evidence: John 19:31 explicitly distinguishes the Sabbath
following Jesus’ death as a “high day” (i.e., not a regular Saturday
Sabbath). Leviticus 23:7 establishes that Nisan 15 is a mandatory
Sabbath regardless of weekday—this is the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
Matthew 28:1 does indeed say “after the Sabbaths” (plural: σαββάτων),
and this is not a scribal error. Mark 16:1 – “When the Sabbath was past,
Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought
spices…” → This refers to buying spices after the first (Thursday)
Sabbath, so it must be Friday. “Three days and three nights” (Matthew
12:40) cannot be forced into a Friday-to-Sunday window without
manipulating Jewish idiom or chronology. Luke 23:56 – “They returned and
prepared spices and ointments; and rested on the Sabbath according to
the commandment.” → This refers to preparing spices on Friday, and then
resting on Saturday.</p>
<p>Day Event Here’s the count if Jesus died Wednesday afternoon: Buried
before sunset Wednesday Night 1: Wednesday night Day 1: Thursday (High
Sabbath) Night 2: Thursday night Day 2: Friday (spice preparation day)
Night 3: Friday night, third night in the tomb Day 3: Saturday (Weekly
Sabbath), third day in the tomb Night 4: Jesus resurrected at the
sundown of Saturday, that is the beginning of Sunday in Jewish calendar
Day 4: Sunday (first day of the week) the tomb was found empty If
resurrection occurred just after sunset on Saturday, it is exactly three
days and three nights. Leading to Thursday, Friday, and Saturday being
the three days and three nights, and the evening of Saturday when the
resurrection allegedly occurred is the beginning of Sunday. So this is
fully consistent with the numerous references to the resurrection on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Why the tomb was found empty Sunday: Because the women waited until
the Sabbath ended (Saturday evening), then came at dawn Sunday (Matthew
28:1, Luke 24:1). That’s when the resurrection was discovered — not when
it happened.</p>
<p>So: Three full days and nights: yes. Resurrection not seen, only tomb
found empty Sunday: yes. Fits Jewish counting and Gospel timeline:
yes.</p>
<p>Then the crucifixion must have happened on Wednesday, April 21, 31 AD
.</p>
<p>Note that for example, the possibly oldest preserved Christian text,
the Didache, explicitly states that fast on Wednesday and Friday. Friday
is likely linked to Sabbath, but Wednesday is a new addition and most
logically it would be the day of crucifixion.</p>
<p>Notably the earliest Christian writers outside the gospels and before
Tertullian (c. 160–220 AD) that talk about the resurrection are Justin
Martyr (c. 100–165 AD) and Barnabas (c. 70–135 AD), both of whom place
the resurrection on at the start of Sunday, but do not list the day of
crucifixion.</p>
<h4 id="subsubsec:jesus-survived-crucifixion">17. Jesus survived
crucifixion</h4>
<p>In this context it is not even inconceivable that the Romans would
have allowed Jesus to be picked up from the cross before death. It is
highly speculative, but it has a really strong explanation power to it.
Perhaps something as trivial as lightnings and thunders could have
already made the Roman soldiers and the crowds to superstitiously
believe he truly was the son of God and got scared. Joseph of Arimathea
and Nicodemus did receive an agreement from Pilate to pull him from the
cross early, and Jesus could have simply survived the trauma and barely
alive. And on the third day he got so much better that he was able to
walk around and talk to the apostles and show his wounds. Then Jesus
died fifty days later due to infection and all started to believe he was
resurrected and ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>Notably all burial care was done at the time of death. It was not
Sabbath yet, and they had allegedly plenty of time to do bury Jesus on
Friday. Yet why would they still tend to Jesus body on Sunday morning?
This could have been a medical care, not just continuation of unfinished
burial process. The eventual death of Jesus from infection, especially
given the severe wounds he suffered, adds a realistic angle to the
story. After his brief recovery, it would be plausible for his body to
succumb to the damage sustained during the crucifixion. This would also
explain why the apostles continued to believe in his resurrection, even
after his eventual death. They might have interpreted his survival and
brief recovery as divine intervention and seen his later death as part
of a larger divine plan. Perhaps all the doubting really did happen as
the apostles were certain that Jesus was dead as they were not
eyewitnesses to the event itself.</p>
<p>Further support to the story is In Mark 15:44, Pilate is described as
being surprised by the news of Jesus’ death, as he expected Jesus to
have been on the cross longer. Mark states: “Pilate was surprised to
hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if
Jesus had already died. When he learned from the centurion that it was
so, he gave the body to Joseph.” This detail suggests that Jesus’ death
was unexpectedly quick. Crucifixion was a prolonged form of execution
designed to last for hours, if not days, as the condemned person
typically died from a combination of blood loss, exposure, and
suffocation. For Pilate to be surprised, it could imply that Jesus’
death occurred more quickly than usual, which is significant
because:</p>
<p>Jesus cries out loudly before dying (Mark 15:37, Luke 23:46):
Crucifixion victims typically die slowly, often suffocating, with fading
strength. A loud cry right before death is unusual and may imply he
still had significant strength—suggesting he was not yet at death’s
door. A burst of strength like this would point more towards a
theatrical performance to convince the others the death was real.</p>
<p>Roman soldiers were typically experienced in carrying out executions,
and the death on the cross was intended to be slow and torturous. The
standard time for death was several hours, and for someone to die within
less than six hours, as Jesus did, would have been unusual. Pilate’s
surprise may indicate that Jesus’ death was significantly quicker than
expected. It may be that Jesus wasn’t fully dead at the time he was
taken down from the cross. It seems likely small omens in the sky mixed
with fear in the crowd and even among the soldiers made Pilate more
receptive to Joseph of Arimathea’s request without carefully checking
Jesus fully passed away. Note that Joseph of Arimathea was a member of
the Sanhedrin, and he was likely a person of influence making it even
more likely Pilate would have been more receptive to his request.</p>
<p>When the Roman soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, blood and
water flowed out, which is often interpreted as a sign of death.
“Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing
a sudden flow of blood and water.” (John 19:34) Trauma, scourging, and
prolonged stress could have caused a buildup of fluid around the lungs
(pleural effusion) or around the heart (pericardial effusion). If
pierced, these fluids could flow out as a mix of clear fluid (“water”)
and blood. If Jesus were completely dead, the blood would have likely
clotted in his body, and the wound wouldn’t produce such a “sudden
flow.” The fact that both blood and water “flowed out” immediately
suggests the body still had some circulatory activity, meaning the heart
might not have fully stopped yet. Pleural or pericardial effusion does
NOT mean the person is already dead—it can happen before death in cases
of extreme shock or injury. It would be likely more than enough to
convince the centurion that Jesus was dead and pass the news to Pilate.
Joseph of Arimathea taking Jesus to his own garden, according to the
gospel of Peter, to bury him there, is also highly suspect. If Jesus
were truly dead, it would be strange for Joseph, not his family, to take
initiative. But if alive, placing him in a personal tomb under control
of a sympathizer makes sense. The excuse that Jesus had to be buried
quickly before the Sabbath in a temporary grave may actually be a plot
to hide the fact that Jesus was not dead yet. Aloes and myrrh for
treatment, not burial (John 19:39): 75 pounds of myrrh and aloes were
brought by Nicodemus. That’s far more than needed for burial alone and
both have known medicinal properties—especially for healing wounds. The
quantity hints at treatment, not embalming. It is also worth noting that
using armed guards to protect the tomb is not a common practice. Armed
guards when the person is still alive would make a lot more sense. For
example some of the opponents of Jesus suspected a foul play and wanted
to make sure Jesus was really dead and not taken down from the cross
alive.</p>
<p>Many scholars point out that Arimathea is a place that does not
exist, and so it is likely a made up name. However, Ar-Ram, also known
as Ramathaim, today better known as Ramallah or Ram Allah, is an ancient
town a few kilometers north of Jerusalem that is more than likely to be
that place. We actually already know Ramallah from the Old Testament,
where it is mentioned as the birthplace of Samuel. Notably early
versions of Septuagint translated the birthplace as “Αρμαθαιμ” in 1
Samuel 1:1, while hebrew text used Ramathaim. It is a natural
translation of the name into Greek, and the Septuagint should be
considered as a strong evidence that Arimathea is indeed Ramallah. It is
also notable enough and close enough to Jerusalem that it would have
been very logical origin place for a prominent member of the Sanhedrin.
It is also notable enough to have been mentioned in the gospels as a
place elevating the status of Joseph of Arimathea and familiar enough to
the people of the story to not be needing any further explanation. The
doubting found in all the gospels is also highly natural. Simply Jesus
being tortured and left for near-certain death but then eventually
surviving would have still been treated as a miracle. Most likely the
apostles really did not believe much in miracles and were not expecting
Jesus to survive.</p>
<p>Finally, many scholars point out that the victim of crucifixion were
always left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers in every known
record. However, even Philo of Alexandria, featured in many discussions
in this book for unrelated reasons, described a case of numerous Jew
insurrectionists in Alexandria in 38AD were actually taken down from the
cross in exchange for a bribe. It is not completely clear from the text,
but the more plausible reading is that some of the victims may have been
taken down from the cross before they died. In this light it should not
be considered as implausible that a member of the Sanhedrin would have
been able to bargain with the centurion to convince Pilate Jesus already
died.</p>
<p>Josephus, Jewish War 4.5.2 (333): He says he recognized three of his
acquaintances being crucified, asked for their removal, and one of them
survived.</p>
<p>Indications do not fully end at the burial, Thomas’ request to touch
wounds (John 20:27) only makes sense if the wounds are fresh and still
healing—rather than glorified.</p>
<p>Summarizing, although partially speculative, there is a lot of
speculation that matches unexpectedly well on close inspection. Addition
of so much of this detail We need to consider the possibilities that
Jesus really died and then numerous propaganda stories were created with
strictly controlled narrative. The non-resurrection theory actually does
suffer very substantially from the problem of consistent narrative. The
ungrounded claims would not be corroborated by everyone in the same way.
There is bound to be more serious discrepancies in the story and more
variants of the story. To witness the fact, there is famously very
serious discrepancy between all the gospels as to how the resurrection
was discovered. This actually strongly corroborates the idea that a lot
of earlier highly consistent narratives were actually independently
attested in the gospels, while the discovery of the missing body must
have been a deliberate attempt to cover up the actual story.</p>
<p>The other alternative is that there really was empty tomb and
misunderstanding. For example, Joseph and Nicodemus really did use a
temporary grave and then moved Jesus to a different grave without
telling anyone. Then the women came to the grave and found it empty and
spread the news to Peter and John and so the story started to spread.
Then the empty grave was undeniable but everyone doubted the
resurrection as they had no certainty that Jesus was resurrected or
simply his body was secretly moved.</p>
<p>So here we need to consider the plausibility that Jesus survived
because of luck or a conspiracy of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus,
and contrast it with the alternative of the event being completely
fabricated.</p>
<h3
id="subsec:was-god-the-father-the-god-of-moses-or-the-god-of-plato">Was
God the Father the God of Moses or the God of Plato?</h3>
<p>In modern Christianity it is completely beyond doubt that God the
Father is YHWH, the God of Moses, the God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob.</p>
<p>Not many are aware that this is actually a surprisingly recent
development in Christianity. Many believe that the distinction of God
the Father from the God of Moses was the heresy of Marcion and one
Marcion has been excommunicated, the Church has always believed that God
the Father is the God of Moses. However, this is not the case. Marcion’s
theory went further than that, he believed that the God of Moses was an
evil god, and that the God of Jesus was a good god. This theory was far
more radical than the idea that God the Father is not the God of Moses,
and that was what was condemned by other thinkers of the early
Church.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, Jesus is described as the Logos, the Word of
God with is very unequivocal reference to the Greek creator deity and
not the God of Moses. A lot more of the philosophy and theology of Logos
has been described by Philo who seems to have had very substantial
influence on the New Testament texts. Saint Paul refers to the God the
Father by “For we are indeed his offspring” which was one of the most
common phrases related to Zeus. Just a moment later he uses the common
greek thought “The God who made the world and everything in it… does not
live in temples… we should not think the divine being is like gold or
silver… In him we live and move and have our being.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most common perspective was expressed by Clement of
Alexandria “God is one and the same, the universal Father, being known
under many names.”</p>
<p>An epitaph from the 5th century AD, written by deeply Christian
family, reads: “Weak at birth with defence of crosses walled, Guiltless
of any dark stain of sin, Little Theodosius, who with pure mind parents
Chose to dip in the sacred baptismal font Cruel death seized. May the
ruler of Olympus’ height Give rest to these members with the noble sign
Of the cross marked, proclaiming an heir of Christ.”</p>
<p>Then we obviously have the images of God</p>
<h4 id="subsubsec:pater-noster">Pater Noster</h4>
<p>In catechisms and commentaries the Pater Noster is presented as a
quintessentially Jewish prayer. Two Gospel forms survive—Matthew 6:9–13
(Sermon on the Mount) and Luke 11:2–4 (disciple request). Its usual
gloss runs like this: • “Our Father in heaven” echoes synagogue formulas
(e.g., the later Kaddish: “Exalted and hallowed be His great Name”). •
“Hallowed be thy Name” = sanctifying YHWH’s Name (already holy in
Israel). • “Thy kingdom come / Thy will be done on earth as in heaven” =
Israel’s hope from Daniel and the Prophets. • “Give us today our daily
bread” = manna typology or Psalmic providence. • “Forgive us our debts…
as we forgive” = Jubilee/Leviticus ethic. • “Lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil” = moral temptations; God’s
protection from sin. On this reading the prayer is “Second-Temple
Jewish” through and through.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Why that neat picture collapses</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Read closely, the prayer pointedly avoids Israel’s covenant markers.
There is no Sinai, no Torah, no Zion, no Abraham, no Sabbath, no
sacrifices—nothing that nails it to Moses. Instead, the vocabulary is
cosmic, royal, solar: • A universal Father in the heavens, not the
covenant God “who brought you out of Egypt.” • A sanctified Name without
the Tetragrammaton or Temple. • A Kingdom that descends from heaven to
earth (cosmic axis), not the restoration of David on Mount Zion. • A
petition for daily bread does not echo manna (which was not daily) or
psalmic providence (which is not daily). • A trial (Greek peirasmos) and
rescue from the Evil One that ring like an eschatological ordeal with a
devouring adversary, not like a generic plea about private
temptations.</p>
<p>The standard reading “works” only by importing background the text
doesn’t supply, while ignoring the imagery it does supply.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Egyptian solar–royal reading (what fits cleanly, line by
line)</p></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>“Our Father in the heavens” Egyptian hymns to Aten and Amun-Ra
address the high god as father of all; the Pharaoh is the son of the
Sun. The address is cosmic, not ethnic. It’s the right register for the
prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>“Hallowed be thy Name” (ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου) Egyptian piety
centers on the Name (rèn). Amun literally means “the Hidden (One)”; his
hidden Name is praised and protected. Refrains like “Your name is
Amun—Amun, Amun” are liturgical. This is precisely a sanctified Name
without pronouncing it—a far tighter fit than Moses’ tetragrammaton
practices as usually described for lay prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>“Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as in heaven.” Every
dawn the Sun restores Maʿat (order) in the heavens and, through the
king, on earth. Solar kingship is a heaven-to-earth pipeline of
will/order. That is exactly the structure of this petition.</p></li>
<li><p>“Give us today our daily bread” (τὸν ἄρτον… τὸν ἐπιούσιον) The
Great Hymn to Aten praises the god who “daily makes bread for
humankind.” Egyptian offering formulas (“bread and beer, daily”) are
standard temple language. This line is almost a quotation in
sense.</p></li>
<li><p>“Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.” Egypt frames
justice as weight at judgment—the heart weighed against the feather of
Maʿat. Being “set right” (absolved of moral weight/debt) is the
difference between survival and obliteration. The ethical turn (“as we
forgive”) binds the worshiper to enact Maʿat socially. This is far
closer to Egyptian moral weight/debt than to later juridical
hair-splitting.</p></li>
<li><p>“Do not bring us into the time of trial, but deliver us from the
Evil One.” (μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς… εἰς πειρασμόν… ῥῦσαι ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ)
Peirasmos = trial/ordeal, not chiefly “temptation.” Read
apocalyptically, it is the great ordeal; read visually, it is the
judgment scene. And the Evil One is not an abstraction: in Egyptian
iconography the failed soul is devoured by Ammit (crocodile-lion-hippo)
as the scales tip. “Deliver us from the devourer” is exactly how the
scene works.</p></li>
<li><p>“Amen.” Before we pretend “amen” is safely, uniquely Hebrew, note
the liturgical practice: Egyptian hymns and responses end with
acclamations of Amun; congregational call-and-response reinforces the
Name. The sound and function of the close match the prayer’s cadence
(whatever the etymology textbooks insist). In worship, “All say
Amun/Amen!” is the logic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line: every clause fits solar-royal liturgy without strain.
The “Jewish only” reading must paper over the prayer’s cosmic grammar;
the Egyptian reading doesn’t.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The historical pipeline (why this imagery would still be
alive)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This isn’t Bronze-Age dust accidentally stuck to a 1st-century text.
It’s continuous culture: • Egypt in Canaan (c. 1500–1150 BC). For
centuries the southern Levant was an Egyptian province. Jerusalem
appears in the Amarna archive (~1350 BC), with its ruler Abdi-Heba
writing Pharaoh as “my Sun.” Egyptian garrisons and cult stood at
Beth-Shean, Jaffa, Deir el-Balah, etc. • Davidic psalmic core
(c. 1150–970 BC). The linguistically older psalms are drenched in sun,
light, heaven, earth, kingship, divine rule (Ps 19; 29; 68; 84; 104).
These read like Hebrew adaptations of solar hymns, not Torah homilies. •
Aten’s revolution and Amun-Ra’s supremacy. Akhenaten’s Aten-monotheism
collapses, but Amun-Ra returns stronger; the solar-monotheist pressure
never disappears. • Ptolemaic Egypt (3rd–1st c. BC). The dynasty crafts
Serapis/Isis cult and keeps solar divine kingship explicit. Cleopatra’s
death (30 BC) is within grandparent memory of Jesus’ generation. •
Jesus’ milieu. A “king of the Jews” claim sits inside Roman
Syria-Palestine, saturated with Helios/Sol imagery. Early Christian art
happily paints Christ as Helios; the holy day is Sunday. The solar-royal
idiom is not alien—it is the water everyone swims in.</p>
<p>Seen through this pipeline, the Pater Noster doesn’t borrow a few
Egyptian phrases; it belongs to the solar-royal register that ran from
Aten → Amun-Ra → Ptolemaic kingship straight into the first century.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>“But isn’t it still Jewish?” — the honest reconciliation</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, the prayer can be prayed in a Jewish key (and was). Luke embeds
it in a lesson on dependence; Matthew frames it within piety and
forgiveness. The wording genuinely overlaps later synagogue language
(“hallowed be His Name”). But that overlap proves adaptability, not
origin. Crucially, the prayer: • avoids covenant particulars, • speaks
in universal solar-cosmic grammar, and • lands perfectly inside
Egyptian/Ptolemaic royal theology.</p>
<p>The better model is fusion: Israel’s high-God devotion absorbed,
translated, and reused the dominant solar-royal grammar everyone
understood. If Jesus stands—as our thesis argues—as a royal claimant in
the wake of a just-collapsed Ptolemaic world, then this prayer reads not
as a synagogue formula but as a dynastic solar-royal prayer: heavenly
Father (Sun), kingdom descending, daily sustenance, righteous scales,
rescue from the devourer—Amen.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Clause-by-clause gloss (for the reader who wants the map) •
Father in heaven → Solar source (Aten/Amun-Ra) and royal sonship. •
Hallowed Name → the hidden Name exalted (Amun’s rèn). • Kingdom come /
will be done → Maʿat restored from heaven to earth via the king. • Daily
bread → the sun-god who daily provides bread. • Forgive debts → lighten
the moral weight at the scales; enact Maʿat with others. • Do not bring
into the trial → spare us the ordeal/judgment. • Deliver from the Evil
One → rescue from the devourer who consumes the failed. • Amen → the
communal seal, functionally identical to Amun-acclamation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Why this matters for David and Jesus • David (1150–970 BC) sits close
enough to the Amarna horizon for Egyptian solar kingship to be living
memory; the oldest psalms sound like it because they grew in it. • Jesus
(early 1st c. AD) stands within living memory of Ptolemaic solar
monarchy. If he is (as our book argues) a royal figure inside that
political theology, the Pater Noster is exactly the kind of solar-royal
prayer a claimant would teach: it translates Egypt’s oldest grammar of
kingship into a form his followers can pray anywhere.</p>
<p>That is the reading that explains everything the text actually
says—without importing Sinai—and explains why the prayer crossed
languages and empires so effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="subsec:jesus-christ-believed-in-true-immortal-soul">Jesus Christ

<p>Sometimes overlooked, the idea of soul in greek and jewish beliefs is

gain the world and forfeit his soul?” (Matt 16:26) “Today you will be

<p>The belief in post mortem conscious existence as a continuation of

<h2 id="sec:chapter-3---the-early-dating-of-gospels">Chapter 3 - The
Early Dating of Gospels</h2>
<p>Acknowledging Jesus as the rightful Christos and his companions as
highly powerful and educated people can completely change the way we
view the gospels. Most notably in this framework all arguments for early
gospels become much more plausible and the arguments for late dating
lose almost all of their plausibility.</p>
<p>Moreover with the dating of the gospels, we can also revisit the
dating of the large number of early apocryphal texts. The apocryphal
texts are typically dated to the second century, but with extreme bias
of past scholars placing them consistently later than the gospels
regardless of the evidence.</p>
<h3 id="subsec:john-gospel">John Gospel</h3>
<h5 id="par:dating-of-the-gospel-of-john">0. Dating of the Gospel of
John</h5>
<p>Famously gospel of John is attested the earliest and has the most
prolific earliest sources, yet it is dated the latest, purely based on
bias coming from invalid assumptions about “christology”. This is one of
these 19th century assumptions of early biblical scholars that falls
apart completely when under any detailed scrutiny, but remains a dogma
of the modern biblical scholarship.</p>
<p>By attested, we have a papyrus P52 of John, which is dated to 125AD.
The allegedly oldest Mark, Matthew and Luke are attested by Irenaeus in
180AD together with several other gospels that are deemed by Irenaeus as
heretical, and the earliest manuscript of Mark is dated to late 3rd
century. Although the oldest mention of Marcion is from Tertullian,
Tertullian himself gives credible attestation of Marcion in 140AD. So,
by current manuscript and reference chronology, the order of attestation
is: John first, followed by Marcion, then Mary Magdalene, Thomas, Judas,
and only later Mark, Matthew, and Luke.</p>
<p>This alone can be explained by the accident of history, most early
sources were lost, and the oldest was John, just by accident. However,
we need to consider this gospel of John was found not alone, but as a
part of a large library with many texts, including other gospels, and
many documents of all kinds, including dated tax documents. The
Oxyrhynchus papyrus P52, was unequivocally written in a script style
that matched the style of dated to around 125AD, but the texts of other
gospels in Oxyrhynchus were certainly at least 25-50 years older.</p>
<p>Although the dating can be disputed, on the basis of geography, in
Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, we have gospels that were written likely in the same
room by the same group of people, so the relative dating of the gospels
as they arrived to Oxyrhynchus is rather certain.</p>
<p>Certainly, it could be the case that the synoptic gospels arrived to
Oxyrhynchus much later just by accident, however, the same pattern is
repeated in the second oldest source of manuscripts, the Nag Hammadi
library, where the Gospel of John is also the oldest and the most
prolific text, and the synoptic gospels are not present at all. Nag
Hammadi manuscripts are a bit older, but the originals allegedly date to
mid 2nd century texts.</p>
<p>The third source fairly securely dated to second century and likely
early second century is the Bodmer papyrus, P66 with the Gospel of John.
As in the other cases, the Gospel of John pre-dates the synoptic Gospels
in the Bodmer collection by at least 25-50 years.</p>
<p>This is essentially it for Gospel references pre-140AD. The only
possible earlier references to Gospels are Papias, Polycarp and Clement,
who plausibly wrote before 140AD. In case of Papias, he refers to
gospels not written in Greek, so they are almost certainly not any of
the canonical gospels nor any of the widely known apocryphal gospels.
Clement and Polycarp are quoting Jesus as in the Gospels, but regardless
of whether Jesus really did say the words, there is no indication
whether they quoted the gospels or the gospels from them or mostl likely
they simply quoted the same text or oral tradition. The next reference
is Justin Martyr, and he again is most likely quoting the Gospel of
John, notably not any quote of Jesus recorded in the Gospel of John, but
a known fragment of John.</p>
<p>Then the later references from Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Origen all
contain unambiguous references to all the canonical gospels as already
mature and wide-spread texts, but at this point we are already in the
year 180AD and later.</p>
<p>To be very clear, this does not indicate John was written in 125AD,
nor that Marcion was written in 140AD. John may have been written in
right after the events described, or it may have been written in
100AD.</p>
<p>What that does show is that based on the dates of manuscripts and
references, it should be John to have the highest probability of being
the earliest gospel, and not Mark, Matthew or Luke.</p>

The Gospel of John is widely accepted to be one gospel that indicates it
was written by an eyewitness.</h5>
<p>The gospel itself claims to be written by the disciple whom Jesus
loved, which is widely accepted to be John. Notably all the other
gospels themselves had ample opportunity to claim to be written by an
eyewitness, but none of them do. Mark portrays himself as an omniscient
narrator, telling a story clearly in third person, does not seem correct
about the geography of the area where the events took place. Luke claims
to have compiled the stories from the eyewitnesses, which is a clear
admission that he was not an eyewitness himself. Matthew is clealy
copying Mark and a source like Luke, while also writing in very detached
third person, not something an eyewitness conceivably would do.</p>

ὁ μαθητὴς ὃν ἠγάπα ὁ Ἰησοῦς</h5>
<p>The frequent reference to the disciple whom Jesus loved, may also be
an indication the disciple was not one of the twelve apostles, as the
gospel of John does not mention the names of the apostles at all.</p>
<p>Notably the gospel of John does name the Twelve on multiple
occasions, but the disciple whom Jesus loved does not seem to be one of
them, while it would have been logical to note that if that were the
case. The disciple whom Jesus loved seems separate from the Peter’s
group. Most notably all gospels seem to strongly indicate all male
apostles fled after the arrest of Jesus, and the only ones who stayed
were women. “There were also women looking on from a distance… Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James… and many other women…” This means
we are faced with either a very major contradiction between John and all
three Synoptics where there was no reason to introduce one, or — far
more plausibly — the Beloved Disciple was not one of the Twelve, and was
a woman, preserved anonymously but recognized within the early community
as an authoritative witness.</p>

Γύναι, ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱός σου</h5>
<p>The famous words of Jesus on the cross — “Woman, behold your son”
(John 19:26) — have traditionally been interpreted as referring to the
Beloved Disciple, but the wording itself is deliberately ambiguous. The
Greek phrase υἱός σου means “your child” or “your son,” but it is not
inherently gender-specific in context. Some scholars, such as Ramon K.
Jusino (1998), have argued that this may point to Mary Magdalene,
especially given her presence at the crucifixion and her prominent role
in resurrection narratives.</p>
<p>It is also entirely possible that the author is one of the other
women from the court of Herod, like Joanna, who was another woman who
named in the gospel of Luke as a follower of Jesus, and who was one of
three women who visited the tomb of Jesus to anoint his body. Many
scholars link Joanna to the court of Herod, and she was the wife of
Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household, which would make her a very
powerful and influential. She is also frequently linked to Junia. As the
name Junia is not mentioned in the gospels, yet Paul considers her to be
the foremost among all the apostles, the connection to the Jesus’s
beloved disciple and a biographer of his life seems very plausible.
Finally, this would also explain the authorship of the gospel as John
not disputed by the early church fathers, as the author would be a
disciple of Jesus, Joanna.</p>

<p>Jesus meets her alone at a well, a setting often symbolizing romantic
or covenant relationships in the Old Testament (e.g., Isaac and Rebekah,
Jacob and Rachel). The conversation is deeply personal because Jesus
reveals he knows her past (five husbands) yet does not condemn her. He
gradually leads her to recognize him as the Messiah, and she becomes a
key figure in spreading his message. The emotional shift—from skepticism
to joy—makes this one of the most transformative personal encounters in
the Gospels.</p>

though women would have been allowed to stay and not prosecuted by the
Romans, who were from a far more patriarchal society and would be very

appears, but she doesn’t recognize him at first, thinking he’s the
gardener. The moment becomes deeply personal when Jesus simply says her
name, “Mary”, and she immediately recognizes him. She calls him ῥαββωνί
(Teacher), showing a deeply personal bond. He then entrusts her with the
first announcement of the Resurrection, making her the first witness of
Easter.</p>

<p>John the Baptist calls Jesus the bridegroom (John 3:29). The first

for a Gospel. The idea of Jesus as a bridegroom has strong symbolic
meaning in Jewish and early Christian traditions, sometimes linking to
the idea of a divine marriage (God and Israel, Christ and the Church).
Some Gnostic and esoteric traditions later emphasized Mary Magdalene’s
connection to Jesus, seeing her as part of this bridal imagery.</p>

<p>The Bechdel test is almost universally determining if a story is
written by a woman.</p>
<p>Notably the gospel of Luke also passes the Bechdel test even better,
but in that case the author is focusing on many female characters may be
due to the sources and sponsors he or she has. Luke also mentions
unusually frequently the words like womb, nursing, mother, birth and
much higher female agency including annunciation to Mary and not Joseph.
Whereas the gospel of John seems to be an original text, Luke is very
clearly a compilation of many sources as admitted by the author, and
overwhelmingly agreed upon by scholars.</p>

Note the women traveling with Jesus and the disciples are also linked to
the royal family of Herod.</h5>
<p>“The Twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of
evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven
demons had come out; Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s
household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support
them out of their own means.” Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna are
specifically named as financial supporters. Joanna was connected to
Herod’s court, meaning she had access to wealth and influence. The
phrase “out of their own means” implies they personally funded Jesus’
ministry. Note, much like Sepphoris, Migdala is also within the same
township as Nazareth. If Mary Magdalene was also highly positioned in
the Herod’s court, then it would make sense that she would have been a
skilled writer, yet perhaps not as skilled as the most prominent
classics. This explains the very deep knowledge of royal greek cult,
while still maintaining some lack of literary sophistication.</p>
<h5
id="par:the-authorship-of-mary-is-typically-dismissed-as-a-possibility-because-of-the-use-of-male-pronouns-in-the-gospel.">13.
The authorship of Mary is typically dismissed as a possibility because
of the use of male pronouns in the gospel.</h5>
<p>This is just skill issues of the scholars. A fully female woman
calling herself a beloved disciple would still use male grammatical
forms. This is because the pronoun is determined by the gender of the
word μαθητής (“disciple”), and even if a female version of the μαθήτρια
exists, the woman would still typically choose to use the default gender
of the word if she does not want to emphasize her gender. And if that is
the case the grammatical forms all over the gospel would still be male,
even though they are completely talking about a female person. This is
not just a very obscure feature of the ancient greek language, but also
the right way to speak in many modern languages like Polish. For example
in Polish, one would always say “Jan Ewangelista był kobietą”, John the
evangelist was (male) a woman and not “Jan Ewangelista była kobietą”
John the evangelist was (female) a woman.</p>
<h5

The Beloved Disciple is thought to have played an important role in the
early Christian community.</h5>
<p>Some scholars argue that John, as a male apostle, would have had more
influence in the early church, and thus, it seems unlikely that a woman
like Mary Magdalene would have been the one to write or serve as a
central figure. The early church’s view of Mary Magdalene is much more
complex than sometimes assumed. Though she was initially marginalized,
she held an important role in early Christian traditions. The Gospel of
Mary, a non-canonical text, suggests that Mary Magdalene had an
influential role, potentially even as a leader among the disciples.
Furthermore, early Christian communities were not as rigid in terms of
gender roles as sometimes portrayed, and there is evidence that women
held significant positions in the early church (e.g., Priscilla, Phoebe,
Thecla).</p>
<h5
id="par:the-gospel-of-john-emphasizes-the-jesus-was-the-only-begotten-son-of-god.">15.
The Gospel of John emphasizes the Jesus was the only-begotten son of
God.</h5>
<p>Unique Relationship with God: Jesus is depicted as having a unique
and intimate relationship with God the Father, one that is unlike any
other. In John 1:14, 18, and 3:16, Jesus is referred to as the
“only-begotten Son” (Greek: μονογενής, monogenēs). This term emphasizes
the uniqueness of Jesus as the Son, as no other figure shares this same
divine sonship.</p>
<h5
id="par:here-there-is-a-very-interesting-perspective-linking-the-gnostic-gospel-of-thomas-with-john">16.
Here there is a very interesting perspective linking the gnostic gospel
of Thomas with John:</h5>
<p>“Jesus said, ‘If they say to you,
<code>Where did you come from?</code> say to them,
<code>We came from the light, the place where the light came into being by itself, established itself and became manifest through their image.</code>If
they say to you, <code>Who are you?</code> say,
<code>We are its children, and we are the elect of the living Father.</code>’ ”
There are a few places where Thomas seems to indicate “we” are all
children of God. The uniqueness of the sonship seems to be very heavily
emphasized in John to the point where it almost seems to become the core
concept of the gospel. Interestingly simultaneously John is making
Thomas into the non-conformist and disbeliever. ch 11. All the disciples
are afraid to go to Jerusalem, but Thomas says, “Let us also go, that we
may die with him.” ch 14. Jesus mentioning he will go to his father.
Thomas doubts. Then Jesus says, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.” You can only come to the
father through the only-begotten son. ch 20. Thomas recognizes. You are
my Lord and my God. This shows Thomas despite being Jesus brother or
twin, likely holding a meaningful claim himself, John may try to
emphasize Thomas could have contested Jesus at first, but then
recognized him as the only rightful heir.</p>
<p>14 John 12:31 (NIV): “Now is the time for judgment on this world; now
the prince (archon) of this world will be driven out.” In this verse,
“archon” refers to Rome or the prince of this world. It signifies
authority and power over the world, but it’s used in a negative sense to
describe the ruler of evil.</p>
<h5
id="par:temple-destruction-is-typically-used-as-a-marker-for-the-dating-of-the-gospels.">17.
Temple destruction is typically used as a marker for the dating of the
gospels.</h5>
<p>This argument is usually applied to the synoptic gospels, but needs a
bit of a different treatment for John. One note though that in case of
John “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”
Unlike in Olivet discourse, the identity and the prophecy of the
destruction of the particular temple in Jerusalem in 70AD is much more
questionable. And that if we do not overemphasize the Mosaic beliefs of
the gospel of John, then the temple could be one of the many many many
other temples destroyed, not necessarily the main temple in Jerusalem.
Note that the temple in Jerusalem was already destroyed by the
Babylonians and then rebuilt and already besieged by romans in 63BC. It
must not have been a very big stretch it could be destroyed again. Note
that Sepphoris was also destroyed by the Roman army during the life of
Jesus, and Jesus was heavily involved in the reconstruction of
Sepphoris.</p>
<h5
id="par:the-females-of-the-greek-period-were-very-empowered-but-not-in-roman-and-jewish-culture.">18.
The females of the greek period were very empowered but not in roman and
jewish culture.</h5>
<p>True—there were multiple female rulers in both the Ptolemaic dynasty
and the Hasmonean kingdom. The Ptolemies had several Cleopatras,
Berenices, and Arsinoës ruling independently or as co-rulers. Even in
the Hasmonean period, Salome Alexandra (76–67 BCE) ruled as queen and
was one of the most powerful figures of her time. This definitely
weakens the argument that a woman couldn’t have written John just
because of gender. If elite women in those circles had power, wealth,
and influence, then a female gospel author (like Mary Magdalene or
another court-connected woman) wouldn’t be impossible. In John 11:27,
Martha says: “ναί, κύριε· ἐγὼ πεπίστευκα ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ
θεοῦ ὁ εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἐρχόμενος.” She uses “Χριστός” (Christos), not
“Μεσσίας” (Messiah). This is significant because John does use “Μεσσίας”
in other places (John 1:41 and John 4:25), but here, Martha is speaking
in Greek terminology. This aligns with John’s overall Greek imperial
framework, rather than a purely Jewish messianic expectation.</p>
<p>John never uses Μεσσίας (Messiah) alone—he immediately translates it
as Χριστός, meaning his audience wouldn’t naturally recognize “Messiah”
as a meaningful title. John 1:41 – “He first finds his own brother Simon
and says to him, ‘We have found the Messiah’ (which is translated
Christos).” (εὑρήκαμεν τὸν Μεσσίαν, ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον Χριστός).
John 4:25 – “The woman said to him, ‘I know that Messiah is coming’ (who
is called Christos).” (Οἶδα ὅτι Μεσσίας ἔρχεται, ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστός).
Both times, it appears in direct speech, meaning these are Jewish
characters (Andrew and the Samaritan woman) using a Jewish term, not the
narrator or author. This is the case where the greeks tried to convince
the Jews to accept Jesus as their rightful ruler as well to additionally
bolster his claim and gather more support.</p>
<p>Nathanael’s declaration: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the
King of Israel!” This means Nathanael is recognizing that Jesus, who is
acknowledged as Christos (a Greek royal title), is not only the ruler of
the Greek world (Christos) but also the king of the Jews, in a more
localized context. The title “King of Israel” acknowledges the Jewish
concept of kingship, which would have been understood as a ruler over
Israel, distinct from the broader Greek context of kingship. Andrew’s
declaration to Simon: “We have found the Messiah.” Andrew is indicating
that Jesus, who is referred to as Christos (the Greek royal title), is
not just the Greek king (Christos) but also the Messiah, a title that
resonates specifically with Jewish expectations of a king. He’s telling
Simon that Jesus fulfills both roles—the Greek Christos and the Jewish
Messiah—and both Jewish and Greek audiences should recognize him as the
ruler of both realms.</p>

In that time, kings and emperors were often called divine, not
necessarily because people believed they were literal gods, but because
divinity was part of royal language and legitimacy.</h5>
<p>For Mary Magdalene, calling Jesus her “God” wouldn’t necessarily mean
she thought he was some abstract deity but rather that he was her true,
anointed ruler—her Christos—just as emperors were called divine. She saw
him as the rightful king, the one destined to rule, and her personal
devotion to him would naturally be expressed in the highest possible
terms. So, when she calls him “Lord” or when Thomas says “My Lord and my
God” in John, it could reflect the same kind of royal language used for
emperors—deep respect, loyalty, and recognition of his ultimate
authority—rather than a fully developed theological doctrine of
divinity.</p>
<h5 id="par:watching-him-die-would-have-been-unbearable.">20. Watching
him die would have been unbearable.</h5>
<p>She had placed all her faith, love, and devotion in him—not just as a
ruler, but as the center of her world. When the Romans crucified him, it
wasn’t just the death of a man; it was the destruction of everything she
believed in. Grief can do powerful things to the mind. Faced with such a
loss, she might have experienced visions, dreams, or an overwhelming
sense that he couldn’t really be gone. The idea that he had risen
wouldn’t have started as a theological claim—it would have been a
desperate, emotional response to the unbearable pain of losing him. At
that moment, she wasn’t just an eyewitness; she was the one who couldn’t
let go.</p>

The resurrection story in John isn’t just a theological claim—it’s a
deeply personal, emotional experience that reflects the profound impact
Jesus had on her life.</h5>
<p>This explains why the resurrection account in John is so intimate and
personal, focusing on Mary’s grief, confusion, and joy. This explains
why it is only Mary who sees Jesus first, and why she doesn’t recognize
him at first—her vision is clouded by tears and despair.</p>
<h5 id="par:description-of-male-nudity">22. Description of male
nudity</h5>
<p>There is an unusual detail of Simon Peter being naked in the presence
of the disciple whom Jesus loved. This detail seems to have no place in
the narrative, and it is not clear why it is included.</p>
<p>Although more sophisticated readings of this passage have been
proposed, the most direct explanation stands out. A woman, emotionally
close to Peter or Jesus, remembering this odd, slightly intimate moment:
“He was basically naked, saw Jesus, and scrambled to cover up before
jumping in.” Peter being “γυμνός” (naked or underdressed) is a kind of
detail a woman would be more likely to remember vividly and include in
her account, especially if she was reminiscing the stories of her youth.
Feels less like theology, more like memory.</p>
<p>And then finally the Jesus’s resurrection is described by the shroud
being left in the tomb with the implication that Jesus was naked when he
met Mary Magdalene. Portraying Jesus as naked meeting a woman would be a
very fit conclusion for a female author romance writer, but would make
very little sense in any other scenario.</p>

The lack of description of physical appearance of Jesus in John seems to
contradict the idea that the author was an eyewitness a woman and a
lover of Jesus.</h5>
<p>Given all the other tropes of female writing, it is something very
surprising at first. One explanation of this is that Philo of
Alexandria, from whom the author of John seems to have borrowed a lot of
ideas, also actively avoided describing the physical appearance of
anyone in his works. It is possible that Philo conveyed this unusual to
us idea to the author of John, and the author of John tried to follow
the best practices of their teacher.</p>
<h5 id="par:john-leaves-out-the-institution-of-the-eucharist.">24. John
leaves out the institution of the Eucharist.</h5>
<p>The Last Supper is a key moment in the synoptic gospels, where Jesus
breaks bread and shares wine with his disciples, establishing the
Eucharist. In John, this moment is replaced with the foot-washing scene
(John 13:1-17), which emphasizes servanthood and humility rather than
the sacramental act of communion.</p>
<p>In the context of Jesus being an observer of Greek religious
traditions, the Eucharist would have been already a set tradition.
Unlike in Greek feasts, a Jewish passover meal would have been centered
around the lamb, and bread and wine rituals would not have been the
center of the meal. Most notably the widespread around that time,
Dionysian feasts would have been centered around the wine and bread
rituals. While drinking metaphorical blood and body of Dionysus would
have been a widespread practice, the drinking of the blood and body in a
Jewish banquet would have been considered a major blasphemy.</p>
<p>Even if we discount synoptic gospels and the letter to Corinthians,
the Didache, a very early Christian text, also mentions the Eucharist as
a well-established tradition.</p>
<p>If the Eucharist was a well-established tradition, and already a
centerpiece of the Christian faith by the late first century, then how
can one possibly explain it just slipped John’s mind?</p>
<p>Also noteworthy, John describes Jesus talking about flesh and blood
in the context of logos, so a modernized version of the Greco-Roman
feast. This is exactly a modern perspective Philo would have embraced,
and it is very likely that the author of John was trying to convey the
same message.</p>
<p>To note, Justin Martyr and Tertullian both accuse followers of
Mythras of copying the Eucharist from the Christians. This only gives a
string indication that the ritual was already prevalent in the pre-Jesus
Greek world.</p>
<h4 id="par:the-message">The Message</h4>
<p>Finally, the traditional view of John being a man. We have to keep in
mind that most scholars agree the very early Christian communities had
very strong influence from women. Figures like Mary Magdalene, Tecla,
Priscilla were all at the forefront of the early church. However, when
the gospels were brought to the Roman writers, text had to be
interpolated to the modern audience. Women leaders were erased from
history, Mary Magdalene made into a prostitute, and Saint Paul 50 years
after his death stared to tell all good Christian women to be silent and
let their husbands do the talking. In that context do we really have any
doubt a gospel written by a Joanna or Mary Magdalene would have been
attributed to a John? There is always a concern that John the beloved
disciple is not mentioned in the synoptic gospels, but maybe the beloved
disciple is actually one of the women mentioned in the synoptic
gospels.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there were many Eastern Roman empresses such as
Theodora, Aelia Eudocia, and Zoe Porphyrogenita. The most famous scholar
of the Byzantine empire, Hypatia was a woman, one possibly the only
meaningful innovator astronomical and navigation tools for many
centuries.</p>
<p>Whereas in the Latin culture the most prominent women had power only
by the virtue of indirect influence on their husband or son.</p>
<h4 id="par:miracles-in-john">Miracles in John</h4>
<p>There are seven miracles in John, which are often called the “signs”
because they point to Jesus’ identity and mission. It is very worth
pointing out that the miracles are not just random show of magic, but
all are conveying the royal authority of Jesus. Also, the miracles may
not be completely a metaphor. Jesus as a ruler very well learned could
have been a skilled healer, or perceived as a skilled healer with the
power of confirmation bias. Notably it is not hard to believe that if
Jesus visited a sick person and the person got better from just a
placebo effect, then the person writing his royal biography would have
been very keen to write about it. Similarly, if Jesus had the resources
to provide food for the hungry, and he showed the high generosity of a
ruler, then the person writing his royal biography would have been very
keen to write about it.</p>
<p>The seven signs in John are as follows: #### 1. Water into wine (John
2:1-11) The transformation of water into wine signifies the arrival of a
new covenant, just as royal feasts marked the legitimacy of kings. ####
2. Healing the official’s son in Herod’s court (John 4:46-54) The
healing of the official’s son and the paralytic demonstrate his power
over life and sickness, which in the ancient world were under divine
royal prerogative. #### 3. Healing the paralytic (John 5:1-9) #### 4.
Feeding the 5,000 (John 6:1-14) Feeding the 5,000 mirrors the provision
of a ruler to his people, akin to divine kingship in Hellenistic and
Jewish traditions. #### 5. Walking on water (John 6:16-21) Walking on
water recalls dominion over the elements, a sign of imperial and divine
control in both Greek and Jewish thought. #### 6. Healing the man born
blind (John 9:1-12) #### 7. Raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-44)
Healing the blind and raising Lazarus emphasize his authority over fate
itself—challenging even the most immutable conditions of human
existence.</p>
<h5 id="par:the-non-miracle-at-the-death-of-jesus.">8. The non-miracle
at the death of Jesus.</h5>
<p>It is also interesting to note that the gospel of John is the only
gospel that does not mention the miracles at the death of Jesus. As a
gospel written by an eyewitness, it is very likely that the author was
present at the crucifixion of Jesus, and would have been able to see the
miracles that happened at the time.</p>
<h5 id="par:conclusion">9. Conclusion</h5>
<p>The lack of mention of the miracles at the death of Jesus in the
gospel of John is a strong indication that the author was actually
attempting to write an accurate account of the events that happened at
the time, and not just a theological treatise. As if you were to
introduce a miracle for theological reasons this would be the number one
place to do it. So although the seven miracles are not necessarily
completely historically accurate, there is no compelling reason to
believe they were not simply slightly exaggerated versions of the truth,
the highlight of actual events where Jesus showed his leadership skills,
knowledge of medicine, and generosity, just embellished as would have
been expected from a royal biography, especially if the author was in
love with Jesus.</p>
<p>What is really worth considering is that the events of the seven
signs were really reported by the beloved disciple by Jesus as accurate.
For I tell you, let him who never exaggerated their manly deeds to their
love interest be the one to cast the first stone.</p>
<h5 id="par:the-gospel-of-john-point">10. The Gospel of John point</h5>
<p>While we discuss the historical Jesus and historical John, there is
one thought that keeps coming back to me.</p>
<p>Nearly every discussion of the Gospel of John is about its theology.
We argue over doctrine and vocabulary and historic accuracy, but maybe
we actually miss the single most important thing in the text.</p>
<p>We have lost the author. We have lost the community that first
carried it. We have lost the Jesus they knew, and the beliefs of the
first church. What survives are copies of copies of copies, shaped by
centuries of shifting theology and changing cultures.</p>
<p>But perhaps the best evidence for the true authorship of the Gospel
of John is not the in any of the individual hard evidence, but rather
the overall message of the Gospel itself. What if the message of love is
so strong, so deep, that it actually became the root of Christianity.
Perhaps when the billions of Christians read the Gospel of John, they
may not realize, but they are subconsciously feeling the love that the
author had for Jesus. Perhaps an ancient letter about a lost love has
become the most powerful and enduring message of love in human history.
Perhaps it is true that love is the only thing we’re capable of
perceiving that transcends the dimensions of time and space.</p>

At the same time the textual analysis of Mark shows that these verses
were added later.</h5>
<p>which is strikingly more formal and technical than the surrounding
Markan language. In the rest of the Gospel, Mark tends to favor more
direct and accessible expressions of Jesus’ teachings and prophecies,
often focusing on clear, vivid imagery. The “abomination of desolation”
is a very specific, technical term that feels more aligned with
prophetic, liturgical, or later theological writing. This suggests it
could be an editorial addition, introduced to reflect later theological
concerns (like the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE) or to align the
passage with more familiar Old Testament imagery.</p>
<h5 id="par:but-in-those-days-after-that-tribulation-mark-1324">4. “But
in those days, after that tribulation…” (Mark 13:24)</h5>
<p>The phrase “after that tribulation” introduces a more formal,
structured apocalyptic expression that contrasts with the more immediate
and direct tone of earlier sections in Mark. Mark’s Gospel typically
uses simple, conversational language, but this phrase carries a more
stylized apocalyptic tone, characteristic of later prophetic writings.
It introduces a period of cosmic upheaval, which is a prominent feature
of later apocalyptic literature (including the Book of Revelation and
some Jewish apocalyptic texts), but less common in the earlier parts of
the Gospel.</p>

(Mark 13:14)</h5>
<p>Language Issue: This passage contains complex terminology like
“desolating sacrilege” and the phrase “set up where it ought not to be”.
While the “abomination of desolation” in earlier prophecies is a
well-established term, this variation feels more convoluted and distant
from the language of Mark’s usual teachings. It introduces an additional
layer of complexity that seems more fitting to later apocalyptic
writers, who used this terminology to indicate ritualistic desecration
in a manner distinct from Mark’s usual straightforward style.</p>

<p>Language Issue: The eternal nature of Jesus’ words is a theme more
common in Johannine literature (John 1:1, 6:68, 14:23). While Mark
presents Jesus as authoritative, this statement emphasizes a
long-lasting theological development that might be at odds with Mark’s
more human-centric portrayal of Jesus. This phrase might also echo
themes found in later Christian writings that focus on the eternal
validity of Jesus’ teachings in a way that is somewhat different from
the earthly mission Mark emphasizes.</p>

<p>Language Issue: The emphasis on the ignorance of the Son regarding
the coming of the Kingdom contrasts with the high Christology that
develops in later texts like John, where Jesus has full knowledge and
authority. While it is possible that this reflects Mark’s emphasis on
Jesus’ humanity, the way the phrase is worded feels slightly out of sync
with the rest of the Gospel, where Jesus is shown to have a strong
authority over time and knowledge of God’s plans. The focus on ignorance
is strikingly different from the confident tone found in later Christian
reflections on Jesus.</p>

<p>Well, likely it was quite soon after the event when the event was

global politics, Jewish and Christian history happened at the time, the
edits were done say decades later, likely different events would have
been on top of the minds of the editors to make the edits. Based on this
alone, we could put the upper end for the dating of the original
manuscript of Mark to before 70AD.</p>

The other arguments for the lower bound of the dating of the gospels
focus on the need to develop the theology of the early church.</h5>
<p>In the context of Jesus being an heir to the greek empire, the gospel
of Mark would not require any development of the theology as it is a
historical account of the final downfall of the greek empire. The
theological part of it would be the resurrection of Jesus, which was not
present in the original gospel of Mark. As such there is little reason
to expect much time to pass between the historical events and the
writing of the gospel of Mark.</p>
<h5
id="par:the-gospel-of-mark-starts-with-the-baptism-of-jesus-by-john-the-baptist.">11
The gospel of Mark starts with the baptism of Jesus by John the
Baptist.</h5>
<p>The baptism of Jesus is a very important event in the gospels, as it
is the event that marks the beginning of Jesus’ reign as the rightful
king of the greek empire. Courtly scribes often start at the beginning
of the reign of the king, and the baptism of Jesus is likely the event
that would have been considered the beginning of his reign. Traditional
scholarship does not provide a good explanation for why the story of
Jesus would start with the baptism by John the Baptist, but in the
context of Jesus being the rightful heir to the greek empire, it makes
perfect sense. The story of baptism is also portrayed as a very public
event, which would have been a very important event for the people to
know about. In all four Gospels, during Jesus’ baptism, a voice from
heaven declares: “This is my Son, whom I love; with him, I am well
pleased” (Matthew 3:17, Mark 1:11, Luke 3:22, John 1:34). This is
significant because, in ancient Jewish and Hellenistic traditions, the
declaration of someone as a “son of God” often had royal connotations,
signifying divine legitimacy or appointment to a kingship. The title
“Son of God” was used for kings in the Hebrew scriptures (e.g., 2 Samuel
7:14) and in Hellenistic traditions for emperors and rulers.</p>
<p>In the context of ancient Jewish and Hellenistic practices, the act
of baptism, particularly with water, was used in various rites of
initiation or purification. However, in the case of Jesus, the
combination of the heavenly voice, the dove, and the symbolic actions
surrounding the baptism could be seen as a formal coronation—especially
given the royal language and imagery associated with it.</p>
<p>Finally, a well known earlier variant of the baptism quote is “Today
I have begotten you” (Psalm 2:7), This phrase (Psalm 2:7), as used in
the Gospel of the Hebrews during the baptism narrative, is not just
about divine sonship. It is a Davidic enthronement formula. Psalm 2 is a
royal psalm, spoken by God to the newly installed king of Israel
(originally for Davidic kings). In Second Temple Judaism, it was widely
understood as Messianic, referring to the anointed one (Christos) who
would rule the nations. The Gospel of the Hebrews’ use of this verse
explicitly identifies baptism as the moment Jesus is declared king—not
metaphorically, but in the tradition of Hellenistic and Jewish
coronation rituals.</p>
<p>10.3 A very interesting but little known fact is that there exists a
common early variant of Luke saying “You are my Son, today I have
begotten you.” This is a very important variant as it is a direct
reference to jesus actually becoming the king or the son of God at the
baptism. Much like the references to temple destruction and additional
resurrection stories this variant was likely erased from the gospel of
Luke when the understanding changed from more political to a religious
one.</p>
<h5 id="par:gospel-of-the-hebrews-variants-of-the-baptism-story">12.
Gospel of the Hebrews variants of the baptism story</h5>
<p>In some fragments, Jesus is portrayed as baptizing others, not merely
receiving baptism.</p>
<p>This reverses the standard narrative and places Jesus in the position
of the initiator, the one who commands and empowers. That act reflects
imperial privilege—a king is not merely initiated, he is the one who now
administers the rites of his reign. This underscores Jesus as king over
a new order, already exercising regal authority.</p>
<p>The Gospel of the Hebrews uniquely calls the Holy Spirit Jesus’s
“Mother,” and she lifts him up by his hair and carries him to Mount
Tabor. This echoes ancient royal investiture scenes, where a deity (or
female embodiment of Wisdom) reveals or blesses a new ruler. Mount Tabor
is symbolic — a “high place” often used in imperial and divine
appearances in both Jewish and Hellenistic traditions. The motif of
being lifted and carried by the Spirit recalls imperial enthronements
where the new king is symbolically raised.</p>
<h5 id="par:royal-psalms">12. Royal Psalms:</h5>
<p>The Psalms contain numerous references to the king being God’s
anointed (e.g., Psalm 2:7, Psalm 45:7), and the baptism scene echoes
these royal motifs. By identifying Jesus as the Son of God and anointing
him with the Spirit, the Gospel writers could be alluding to these royal
traditions, suggesting a coronation-like event rather than merely a
religious cleansing.</p>
<h5
id="par:the-dove-descending-on-jesus-at-his-baptism-is-a-symbol-of-divine-approval-and-empowerment.">13
The dove descending on Jesus at his baptism is a symbol of divine
approval and empowerment.</h5>
<p>The Dove as a Divine Symbol: In Greek and Hellenistic cultures, the
dove was often associated with various divine manifestations,
particularly linked to gods like Zeus and Apollo. A dove descending from
heaven was a common symbol of divine approval or empowerment, as in the
case of Zeus transforming into a dove in some myths. In Hellenistic
royal ideology, the idea of divine signs, such as a dove appearing at
the moment of a king’s or leader’s coronation, was not unusual. Dove and
the “Anointing” of Rulers: Greek rulers and Roman emperors were often
seen as divinely chosen, and symbols of divine approval—such as a
dove—would serve to emphasize this idea. The use of a dove in the
baptism of Jesus could be interpreted as a sign that Jesus is divinely
anointed for kingship, in line with how Hellenistic rulers were often
anointed by the gods.</p>
<h5
id="par:the-gospel-of-matthew-includes-the-details-of-the-birth-of-jesus-with-the-visit-of-the-magi.">14.
The gospel of Matthew includes the details of the birth of Jesus with
the visit of the Magi.</h5>
<p>The visit of the Magi has been universally accepted as an allegory
but as mentioned in the previous chapter, the titles of the Magi are
exceedingly hard to fabricate by even the most knowledgeable of scholars
in the Roman empire that were not greek empire loyalists. The Herod’s
massacre of the innocents is also universally accepted as allegory, but
as outlined in the Jesus Dynasty, the massacre of the innocents likely
refers to Herod’s killing of multiple of his own children and their
families. In the context that Joseph was likely too of the Hasmonean
family, giving birth in the city of the Hasmonean dynasty, Bethlehem, is
again a lot more likely to be a real event than an allegory. Similarly,
the flight to Egypt is likely a real event as a noble family would have
had more than enough resources to flee to and be welcomed in Egypt for a
few years.</p>

likely an edit to the original gospel of Mark.</h5>
<p>πορευθέντες οὖν μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη Make disciples of all
nations – Spread the teachings of Jesus to people all over the world.
Here the word “nations” is a translation of the Greek word “ethne,”
which can also be translated as “Gentiles” or “non Baptize them in the
name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit – Initiate them into
the faith through baptism. Teach them to obey everything I have
commanded you – Continue teaching and guiding new believers to follow
Jesus’ teachings. Jesus promises his presence –”And surely I am with you
always, to the very end of the age.” The great commission is essentially
what the emissaries of the greek empire would have been doing, spreading
the decrees of the king across the empire.</p>

The gospel of Matthew also includes the genealogy of Jesus, which is
widely accepted as not-genuine or lost to history.</h5>
<p>However, with the acceptance of the theory that Jesus was the
grandson of Herod the Great, the genealogy of Jesus through Joseph as
his adopted father would require a more thorough examination. One
notable figure from this lineage are Zerubbabel, who was a governor of
the Persian province of Yehud, or Judea, and can be dated to around
520BC. Making best guess estimates to the years of the other figures in
the genealogy, the Eleazar fits very well with son Eleazar of Onias I,
who was the high priest of the temple in Jerusalem. From these we can
fairly obviously link Matthan to Mattathias Hasmonean, Father of Judas
Maccabee, leader of Maccabean Revolt.</p>

<p>Based on the estimated lifespans of the figures in the genealogy, the
Jacob mentioned in the genealogy would be Alexander Jannaeus, whose
unusual name is also mentioned in the lineage of Mary in the Luke gospel
may have been recorded by Matthew as a more familiar sounding Jacob.
Regardless of the exact identities of all figures, there is enough data
here to conclude that the genealogy of Jesus in the gospel of Matthew is
not a complete fabrication, but a genuine attempt to trace the lineage
of Jesus through Joseph. It is true we may never find the true identity
of Abuid, but for the argument to be valid, all we need to accept is
that Matthew attempted to trace Jesus lineage though Hasmonean dynasty
through some historical figures and focusing on more prominent ones.
There were more figures between Mattathias and Jesus, but the genealogy
is by design listing only the most prominent ones to show Jesus descent
from the well known powerful kings, and not an attempt to list every
single person in the family.</p>
<p>Again, gospels are starting with baptism of Jesus, state Jesus’s
lineage and show Jesus teaching with parables, and perform miracles and
forgave sin. This is precisely what you expect from royal chronicles of
the time. Start add the lineage of the king, describe coronation,
describe the reign when the rules show wisdom and power control over
nature and human fate. Then later version may add omens and prophecies
of the king’s birth, and the death. There is absolutely nothing special
about gospels here.</p>

Possibly the most prominent element of the gospel of Matthew is the
reference to the Jewish scriptures and the fulfillment of the prophecies
at seemingly every turn.</h5>
<p>As such the gospel seems to be with a very high probability written
by a prominent Jewish priest, who was also a greek empire loyalist.
There is a theory with substantial textual evidence that the gospel of
Matthew was written by the Jewish priest Mattathias ben Theophilus. That
theory is also not generally accepted as it requires a pre-70AD dating
of the gospel of Matthew, however, withing the context of discussed in
this book, that argument is not valid, and based on other observations
made in the framework that theory becomes the one more likely than the
traditional dating.</p>
<h5
id="par:the-gospel-of-luke-also-includes-a-number-of-edits-most-notably-the-birth-narrative-of-jesus.">19.
The gospel of Luke also includes a number of edits, most notably the
birth narrative of Jesus.</h5>
<p>The birth narrative seems to be full of internal contradictions and
is at odds with the gospel of Matthew the events of which have some of
the extremely remarkable facts corroborating to the rest of this theory.
The genealogy of Jesus in the gospel of Luke, notably has even more
genuine figures from the Hasmonean dynasty down to the father of Mary,
Heli, which is a short form of Eliakim, which is the same name as
Joachim, which is the father of Mary in the protoevangelium of James. If
we accept that the gospel of Luke was written as a correspondence with
the author of the gospel of Matthew, the dating of it would also not be
far removed.</p>
<h5
id="par:the-gospel-of-marcion-deserves-another-look-in-this-context.">20.
The gospel of Marcion deserves another look in this context.</h5>
<p>Even though the gospel of Marcion is dated to the 2nd century, the
gospel is also remarkably missing the pre-cognition of the destruction
of the temple. Much of modern textual analysis places the gospel not as
an edited version of the gospel of Luke, but as an earlier version of
the gospel of Luke, due to the simpler language and the lack of the
birth narrative of Jesus.</p>
<h5
id="par:the-gospel-of-luke-describes-how-jesus-engaged-with-temple-leaders-and-the-jewish-elite-when-he-was-a-child.">21.
The gospel of Luke describes how Jesus engaged with temple leaders and
the Jewish elite when he was a child.</h5>
<p>We are told Joseph and Mary settled in Galilee, but they traveled to
Jerusalem for the Passover festival every year. This is consistent with
Mary being a member of the Hasmonean dynasty, as the Hasmoneans were
known to have a strong connection to the temple in Jerusalem. This
theory fully explains how Jesus would realistically be able to engage
with the temple leaders and the Jewish elite at such a young age. As per
his wise man reputation, it is very likely that Jesus was a child
prodigy, and would have been eager and able to engage with the temple
leaders about scriptures and the law at a very young age. Likely if
Jesus was a child prodigy, he would have been studying Jewish and Greek
scriptures and philosophy in Egypt and in Galilee. Galilee libraries in
Sepphoris would have been precisely well stocked with the works of the
Greek philosophers and the Jewish scriptures fully accounting for
Jesus’s teachings.</p>
<h5
id="par:luke-is-using-greek-historical-writing-style-and-the-gospel-is-written-not-a-religious-text.">22.
Luke is using greek historical writing style, and the gospel is written,
not a religious text.</h5>
<p>Ancient Greek Historians’ Opening Formula: Luke’s opening in Luke
1:1-4 mirrors a well-established convention in Greek historical writing.
The common formula in works by historians like Herodotus and Thucydides
begins with a clear intention to provide a factual account and a claim
of reliable sources. The historian often says that he will provide a
narrative based on careful research and interviews with eyewitnesses.
Similarly, Luke introduces his gospel by stating that many have already
written accounts, and he aims to write “an orderly account” based on
what he has investigated carefully (Luke 1:3). This intro not only
appeals to the authority of eyewitness testimony but establishes the
writer’s credibility—a trait highly valued in Greek historiography.</p>
<p>By establishing this historian’s formula, Luke is distancing his
account from mythical or legendary stories. This is similar to the way
Herodotus sets himself apart from storytellers or poets, aiming for
historical accuracy. His explicit claim of factual investigation is
Greek historiographical technique.</p>
<p>He says many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that
have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by
those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
(note he was a servant of the word)</p>
<p>Emphasis on Historical Accuracy: Luke consistently anchors his
narrative with real, known political figures and chronological details.
For example, he refers to the reign of Caesar Augustus (Luke 2:1), the
governorship of Quirinius (Luke 2:2), and the rule of Pontius Pilate
(Luke 23:1-25). This is highly reminiscent of Greek historians,
especially Thucydides, who grounds his narrative in precise dates and
political actors (e.g., the years of the Peloponnesian War). Public Acts
and Decrees: The Roman census (Luke 2:1-3) is a key event that ties the
story into the broader imperial political world. This is a hallmark of
Greek historical writing, where historians would use official decrees or
military campaigns as turning points in the narrative. Similarly, Acts
uses references to imperial trials and Roman legal processes (e.g.,
Paul’s trial before Gallio, Acts 18:12-17) as a means to legitimize
Christianity and explain its spread through the empire. Roman Emperors
and Local Leaders: The mention of Herod the Great in the narrative helps
place the events within a concrete political framework. Like Polybius,
who uses the actions of local leaders as windows into the larger
workings of an empire, Luke does the same. He mentions Herod as a
regional figure whose reign is significant not just in its own right but
as a piece of the greater political puzzle.</p>
<p>Luke’s precise use of geographical locations, like Judea, Galilee,
and Capernaum, adds to this historical framework, providing context for
the actions of Jesus and the early church in a way that closely
resembles the method of ancient historians who anchored their stories in
known historical settings.</p>
<p>Unified Narrative: Luke and Acts together form a single, continuous
narrative. The structure itself is highly methodical, resembling the way
historians like Polybius wrote histories that were divided into books or
volumes that followed the chronological development of key events.
Luke’s work is divided between the story of Jesus’ life and ministry
(Luke) and the early history of the Christian church (Acts). The
transition from the life of Jesus to the apostles’ missions parallels
how ancient historians would follow a ruler’s life and then shift to his
empire’s activities.</p>
<p>Political and Religious Movements: Just as Polybius traces the rise
and fall of Rome, or Suetonius traces the lives of emperors, Luke
similarly focuses on political and religious figures and their movements
through the empire. His narrative of Paul’s missionary journeys (in
Acts) mirrors the structure of royal chronicles, detailing the
challenges and legal trials faced by a prominent political figure (Paul)
on his travels through the empire.</p>
<p>Speech as Political Tool: Luke often uses speeches by Jesus and Paul
to express core theological and political ideas. These speeches resemble
the formal rhetoric found in Greek histories, where kings or political
figures deliver speeches to clarify their goals and assert their
legitimacy. In Acts, for instance, Paul’s speeches before kings
(Agrippa, Acts 26) or the Sanhedrin (Acts 23) are presented in a
historical context where the figure is asserting his political and
religious identity. Strategic Use of Legal Trials and Defenses: Much
like Plutarch or Suetonius, who present key speeches in the trials of
emperors or important political figures, Luke uses trials and defenses
(such as Paul’s before Festus and Agrippa) to emphasize the legitimacy
of the Christian message. These trials are strategically placed in the
narrative to reflect not only political struggles but also theological
defense—showing that the new movement aligns with or challenges imperial
policy in ways that are deeply significant.</p>
<p>The Divine Favor of Jesus and Paul: The portrayal of Jesus’ divine
mission and Paul’s apostolic authority mirrors the way Greek historians
often depicted kings or emperors as possessing divine favor. Luke’s
consistent depiction of Jesus’ miracles and Paul’s visions and divine
encounters frames the early Christian movement as divinely ordained,
much like the way kings and rulers were seen as divinely chosen or
supported in Greek histories.</p>
<h5
id="par:luke-places-the-lineage-of-jesus-at-the-baptism-not-at-the-birth.">23.
Luke places the lineage of Jesus at the baptism, not at the birth.</h5>
<p>Scholars argue that Jesus lineage placed after birth narrative is an
evidence that the birth narrative was added as a scribal edit. However,
this is not a valid argument, as if the scribe went to the effort of
adding major piece of text and blend it well into the narrative and the
core idea of the author, how could he have just omitted moving the
lineage to the beginning of the text?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that the lineage was not intended to be at the
beginning of the text, and was given at the baptism of Jesus when
proclaiming him as the rightful king.</p>
<h5 id="par:later-gospels-and-apocryphal-texts">24. Later gospels and
apocryphal texts</h5>
<p>It is important to note that to judge the significance of the dating
of the texts, or really any claims in any historical work, it is
important to address all evidence available, not just the evidence
supporting the claim. The emphasis is that while some texts like the
gospel of Hebrews, the gospel of Marcion, the protoevangelium of James,
gospel of Thomas, are indeed very likely very tied so independent source
testimonies, there are a large number of writings, although seemingly
expanded narrative, seem to be fully derived from other texts and do not
bring any new source. One example is the very common gospel of Nicodemus
or the Acts of Pilate, which, although it adds a lot of human
interactions, does not seem to bring up any fresh or contradictory
information at all that would not be a natural embellishment or
interpolation of the original texts. Thus, it is very likely only
composed based on other known texts and not on an unknown source or a
direct testimony of first or second hand witness.</p>

Pauline Epistles to All Nations</h2>
<p>πορευθέντες οὖν μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη “Go, therefore, and make
disciples of all nations.”</p>
<p>The key point missed by most scholars is that panta ta ethnē does not
refer to “all nations” universally, but rather to the nations of the
Greek world. The Septuagint consistently uses ethnē to describe the
nations under God’s rule—those invited into covenant—not every nation
globally.</p>
<p>Καὶ εὐλογηθήσονται ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς “And in
your seed, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.” This is a key
passage used in early Christianity (Galatians 3:8) to show that all the
nations were meant to be part of God’s covenant, not just outsiders.</p>
<p>Βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ πάντες λαοὶ, ἄρχοντες καὶ πάντες κριταὶ γῆς…
ὑψώσεως κεράτων λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὕμνος πᾶσι τοῖς ὁσίοις αὐτοῦ, τοῖς υἱοῖς
Ἰσραὴλ, λαῷ ἐγγίζοντι αὐτῷ. “Kings of the earth and all peoples, rulers
and all judges of the earth… a hymn for all His saints, the sons of
Israel, a people near to Him.” The “kings of the earth and all peoples”
are brought into God’s rule, but the focus remains on God’s people.</p>
<p>All nations referred to God’s people, not necessarily only Greek
ethnicity, but all nations who proclaimed the rule of God. So that would
also include Jews and</p>

The early dating of the gospels can make the letters of Paul more
plausible as it seems Paul already has the knowledge of at least one of
the gospels and the acts.</h5>
<p>Many scholars dispute the existence of Paul based on the striking
contradiction in mainstream scholarship that authors of Pauline epistles
seem to have the knowledge of the gospels and the acts, and yet the
gospels and the acts are unanimously dated to be written after the
Pauline epistles. In here the existence of Paul can once more be
reconsidered if we acknowledge the early dating of the gospels and the
gospel of John in being written by an eyewitness of Jesus’s life.</p>
<h5
id="par:what-is-quite-striking-is-that-paul-and-others-write-to-so-many-different-churches-over-the-short-period-of-time.">2.
What is quite striking is that Paul and others write to so many
different churches over the short period of time.</h5>
<p>There is a major challenge for the traditional timeline of the
apostles establishing so many churches in such a short period of time.
These churches would have to all be established, grow, keep up to date
with the fastly shifting theology, and then do nearly nothing for the
next 100 years. These churches immediately showed up in every single
major city in the former greek empire, and no churches showed up
anywhere else. All of the correspondence and scripture was written in
Greek, and no other languages. It is important to point out that greek
was absolutely not the lingua franca in any part of the Roman empire,
that was not recently part of the greek empire. The lingua franca of the
Roman empire was Latin, and that was the only language that was used in
the administration and the primary language used by the authors. If the
apostles were to establish churches everywhere in the Roman empire, and
not just in the former greek empire, then we would have had the epistles
to the extremely prominent cities of Mediolanum, Lutetia, Aquilea,
Lugdunum, Memphis, and Londinium. The truth is that no matter how we
model the growth of the early church, it is not possible to explain the
the patterns we observe. and then for the next 100 years do not add any
new churches.</p>
<p>There were essentially no prominent cities in the former greek empire
that were not mentioned in the acts and the epistles:</p>

<p>The Roman empire was very tolerant of other religions, and the only
time they would prosecute a religion was if it was a threat to the
empire. There are some claims that other religions were not exclusive
and people could believe in multiple gods, and give offerings to Zeus,
but very little has ever been produced to support this very dubious
claim.</p>

The phrase “soldiers of Christ” is not used explicitly in the Gospels,
but it appears prominently in the Pauline Epistles, particularly in the
context of the Christian life being compared to a military struggle or a
spiritual battle.</h5>
<p>The most famous reference to “soldiers of Christ” comes from 2
Timothy 2:3-4, where Paul uses military imagery to describe the
commitment and discipline required for Christian ministry: 2 Timothy
2:3-4 (NIV): “Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ
Jesus. No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs,
but rather tries to please his commanding officer.” This metaphor
emphasizes the dedication and discipline expected from Christians,
likening them to soldiers who are focused on their mission and loyalty
to their leader, which in this case is Christ Jesus.</p>
<h5
id="par:paul-barely-mentions-the-life-of-jesus-and-almost-never-quotes-him.">8.
Paul barely mentions the life of Jesus, and almost never quotes
him.</h5>
<p>It is frequently claimed that Paul’s religion is not the religion of
Jesus, but the religion about Jesus. There is a shocking lack of
references to any of the teachings of Jesus, the Jewish law, and any of
the events surrounding Jesus’s life and death. So we may go one step
further. It is a religion focusing on restoring the kingdom of God by
resurrecting the office of the Christos, the rightful king of the
kingdom of God. And so to Paul and all the early Christian, it was a all
about resurrecting a Christ not teaching of the particular Jesus Christ.
The idea that the God will once again send a king that will restore the
greek empire, the kingdom of God, headed by Christos, the rightful
earthly king of the kingdom of God.</p>
<h5 id="par:using-this-conspiratorial-language-clearly-worked">9. Using

Alexandria was the capital of the Greek Empire and the center of the
Hellenistic world and yet there are no missions or letters to
Alexandria.</h5>
<p>The absence of Alexandria in the New Testament is striking,
especially considering its significance and proximity to Jesus’s life
and the early Christian movement. Alexandria was erased from the text,
as it was the origin city of Apollos, as well as some of the other
companions or contacts of Paul in like Mark, Demas, and Luke. (Mark and
Luke that are often presumed to be the evangelists). Although we do not
know if Mark mentioned in Pauline epistles is the same Mark as the one
who wrote the Gospel of Mark, and that he really came from Alexandria,
cities of origin is something we can be more trusting about as people
making up tradition are less likely to make up the city of origin.</p>
<p>We are looking here at Alexandria missing as the largest city while
the next 30 cities or regions are mentioned. An interpretation withing
this theory was that Alexandria was the center of the Greek Empire and
the apostles came from there to other nations to spread the word of God,
the word that originally came from Alexandria. So they were envoys from
Alexandria to all nations. At the same time we know the Christian
movement was very strong in Alexandria from the very oldest records on
early Christianity we have. When we look at some of the most influential
early church fathers, we see Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and
Athanasius of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Since Alexandria was such an integral part of the Greek imperial
world, the apostles or early missionaries didn’t have to make the same
kind of outreach there that they did in other regions. Their mission was
not to convince Alexandria to join the cause, but to spread it elsewhere
in the Greek world, with the understanding that Alexandria was already
aligned with the goal of restoring the empire.</p>
<p>This is not too dissimilar from how Ptolemaic empire is almost
completely missing from the Old Testament even though it was where the
story of the Old Testament took place.</p>
<p>The absence of Alexandria in the New Testament is very hard to
explain within any common theories of historical Jesus. We see a lot of
activity and communication with the second and third most significant
cities which are Antioch and Ephesus, that also had a very strong Jewish
presence, also heavily influential, also deeply philosophical and well
educated for the era, so it was not like apostles tried to prioritize
major cities less, or cities with a strong Jewish presence or cities
with where convincing population to change the views could be
harder.</p>

Apostles doing imperial work of letting all nations of the empire know

<h5 id="par:acts-opens-with-a-royal-enthronement">10. Acts opens with a
royal enthronement</h5>
<p>Acts 1:6 — “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to
Israel?” This is not a spiritual question. It implies Jesus had a claim
to political kingship. Your theory: Jesus was understood as the rightful
monarch of a revived kingdom—a successor to the Herodian or Hasmonean
thrones under Greek imperial ideals.</p>
<h5 id="par:jesus-is-taken-up-like-an-emperor">10. Jesus is taken up
like an emperor</h5>
<p>Acts 1:9–11 — The Ascension mimics apotheosis scenes (e.g.,
Alexander, Roman emperors). It frames Jesus in imperial terms, being
enthroned in heaven—like a divine emperor. This matches your view that
Christianity was about loyalty to the “Christ Emperor.”</p>
<h5 id="par:the-pentecost-scene-mimics-an-imperial-inauguration">10. The
Pentecost scene mimics an imperial inauguration</h5>
<p>Acts 2 — Multilingual miracle and mass conversion reflects the
imperial ideal of uniting nations under one divine king. This isn’t
random spiritualism—it reflects a Hellenistic, cosmopolitan imperial
theology. The language of “tongues” is political: the emperor’s message
is for all nations.</p>
<h5 id="par:acts-5-the-trial-of-the-apostles">10. Acts 5: The trial of
the apostles</h5>
<p>Gamaliel references past revolutionary figures—Theudas and Judas the
Galilean. This acknowledges that messianic revolts were political, and
that Jesus’ movement was seen in similar terms. It subtly affirms that
Jesus was considered a royal claimant and threat.</p>
<h5 id="par:stephens-speech-in-acts-7-is-anti-temple">10. Stephen’s
speech in Acts 7 is anti-Temple</h5>
<p>Stephen attacks the Temple and Mosaic tradition, echoing Philo and
Stoic-influenced criticisms of Jewish legalism. This supports your view
that early Christianity rejected the Mosaic religion and aligned more
with philosophical monotheism.</p>
<h5 id="par:paul-as-imperial-envoy">10. Paul as imperial envoy</h5>
<p>Paul appeals to Caesar, travels through Greek cities, and preaches to
Hellenized elites. His speeches (e.g., Acts 17 in Athens) are clearly
political-philosophical, not sectarian Jewish. Acts frames Paul as a
kind of philosopher-diplomat for the Christ-emperor, aligning with your
imperial theology model.</p>
<h5 id="par:acts-ends-without-resolution">11. Acts ends without
resolution</h5>
<p>The book ends in Rome, with Paul freely preaching “the kingdom of
God.” It lacks a narrative climax because its real message is that the
empire is now Christian. It presumes a pre-existing audience that sees
Christianity as a political-theological force.</p>

<h5 id="par:james-the-just-also-wrote-an-epistle-to-all-nations.">1.
James the Just also wrote an epistle to all nations.</h5>
<p>He was the brother of Jesus, and the next in line to the throne.</p>
<p>Much like Jesus Christ the Soter, James also held a royal title, the
Just.</p>
<p>James the Just also wrote an epistle to all nations, which is
included in the New Testament. Interestingly, James, like John, refers
to the same understanding of Logos as Philo of Alexandria.</p>
<p>The writing style of James and John also bear a striking resemblance
to the writing style of Philo of Alexandria.</p>
<p>In Greek, James 1:21 reads as: “Διὸ ἀποθέμενοι πάσαν ἀκαθαρσίαν καὶ
περισσείαν κακίας ἐν πραΰτητι δέξασθε τὸν ἐμφυτον λόγον, ὃς δύναται
σῶσαι τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν.” Transliteration: “Dio apothemenoi pasan
akatharsian kai perisseian kakias en prautēti dexasthē ton emphuton
logon, hos dynatai sōsai tas psychas hymōn.” A literal translation would
be: “Therefore, putting away all filthiness and the overflow of
wickedness, with meekness receive the implanted word, which is able to
save your souls.”</p>
<p>It should go without saying that the advanced writing style of James
and John is not something that would be expected from a simple fisherman
or a son of a carpenter.</p>

<p>According to this claim we would expect Julius Caesar, the People and
the Senate of Rome, Virgil, Seneca to all be fluent and write and speak
extensively in Greek.</p>
<p>In fact, it is correct Greek was the administrative language of
nearly the oll of the former Greek empire which later became known as
the Eastern Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Notably nearly all Christian writers including Clement of Rome,
Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen wrote in
Greek.</p>
<p>The first non-greek church father is Tertulian close to the end of
second century.</p>
<p>In this chapter we want to highlight that Christianity was Greek-only
religion, while there were many mentions of Jesus in non-greek sources,
and very notably, religious sources about written in coptic, were not
considered the same religion as Christianity.</p>
<p>In this chapter we look at the writings of the church fathers from
the prism of the Byzantine Empire resurgence.</p>

Alexandria Egypt suffered enormous hardship and persecution during the
Roman Empire.</h5>
<p>The 200-year struggle of the Rome to conquer all the Greek world
ended in enormous tax burden of the newly conquered territories. Almost
all tax revenue of the Roman Empire at the time of Jesus and shortly
after was coming from the newly conquered territories of the Greeks and
nearly half of it came from Egypt. It is often misunderstood that Egypt
was simply so wealthy and more developed than the rest of the world that
it could account for such a large share of the tax revenue. Egypt was
indeed the richest, but by no means by such a large margin. The tax was
simply so high to transfer the wealth of the Greeks to Rome and destroy
the heartland of the Greek world and their capability to resist in the
future. Given the hardships that the Greeks suffered, there should be no
doubt they would seek to restore their kingdom of God and not be ruled
by the beast of Rome.</p>
<p>Egypt was considered property of the emperor and not subject to
normal senatorial and imperial governance system.</p>

Many other early Christian texts were written to seemingly promote the
restoration of the Eastern Roman Empire.</h5>
<p>The Clement of Alexandria, a very prominent early Christian
theologian, wrote in his book “Stromata” that the true philosophy was
the Greek philosophy, and that the Greek philosophy was the true
philosophy. He wrote of the bird Phoenix, which was a symbol of the
Eastern Roman Empire, and that the bird was purple, which was the color
of the Eastern Roman Empire. Universally the phoenix has been assumed to
be a symbol of the resurrection of Jesus, but the phoenix was a symbol
of the Eastern Roman Empire.</p>

The very famous shields of with the Chi-Rho symbol were a symbol of the
creation of the Eastern Roman Empire.</h5>
<p>The creation of the Eastern Roman Empire as a kingdom of God ruled by
the Christ by a Christian army of Christian emperor Constantine was a
very important event in the history of the world. At that point the
symbol of the soldiers was not a cross. The symbol of the soldiers was
the Chi-Rho symbol, which was a symbol of the Christos. Note the shields
only signified the Christos on them and not Jesus directly, which may
have been a designation that we are the soldiers of the Christ, rightful
king of the kingdom of God, and the battles for the restoration of the
kingdom of the Christos. If the war was thought for religious reasons
primarily, there would have likely been a lot more emphasis on the cross
and mass conversions to Christianity, and we do not that being strongly
emphasized in the historical records of this particular war. We do
however see the large emphasis on political changes and restoring the
rule in the East.</p>

The Apocalyptic Restoration - The End of Time and the Empire:</h5>
<p>In the Apocalyptic literature, particularly found in Revelation,
Christians looked forward to a new heaven and new earth (Revelation 21).
The New Jerusalem would come down from heaven, and it was often
interpreted as both a spiritual and literal kingdom that would restore
what was lost with the fall of the world. Eschatological visions were
tied to the restoration of an empire under Christ’s rule, not just in a
spiritual sense, but in a political and cosmic sense. The Roman Empire
was viewed by some as a precursor to the final divine kingdom.</p>

Similarly, Origen (c. 185–254 AD) also held that Christianity could
restore the world order. He saw the future reign of Christ as the
ultimate restoration of order, justice, and peace in a new universal

Irenaeus (c. 130–202 AD) - In his work Against Heresies, Irenaeus speaks
about the role of the Roman Empire in God’s providence and the eventual
victory of Christianity. He hints at a future unity and a cosmic victory
which could be seen as the “restoration” of the world through Christ’s
reign.</h5>
<p>Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130–202 AD) In his Against Heresies, Irenaeus
focuses on defending orthodox Christian beliefs, but there are also
passages where he highlights the role of the Roman Empire in God’s plan.
He stresses that the empire’s rule is part of God’s providence and
suggests that its peaceful reign is a way of preparing the world for
Christ’s return, offering a sense of the empire’s importance in
Christian restoration.</p>

Tertullian (c. 155–240 AD) - In his writings, such as Apology and On the
Resurrection of the Flesh, Tertullian often implies the eventual triumph
of Christianity within the Roman Empire, framing it as part of a divine
plan. While he doesn’t directly speak of the “restoration” of the
empire, there is a sense of Christianity fulfilling the destiny of the
Roman state.</h5>
<h5 id="par:eusebius-of-caesarea-c.-260340-ad">8. Eusebius of Caesarea
(c. 260–340 AD)</h5>
<p>In his work Ecclesiastical History and Life of Constantine, Eusebius
explicitly presents the rise of Constantine and the establishment of
Christianity as the fulfillment of God’s plan for the Roman Empire. He
sees Constantine’s reign as a “restoration” of the empire, aligning it
with divine will. This reflects the idea that Christianity would not
only restore the empire but also bring it to its true, Christian
purpose.</p>
<h5 id="par:athanasius-of-alexandria-c.-296373-ad">9. Athanasius of
Alexandria (c. 296–373 AD)</h5>
<p>In his writings, particularly in his defense against Arianism and his
theological works, Athanasius talks about the cosmic victory of Christ
over evil, which has implications for the empire’s restoration. He often
frames the Christian emperor as the rightful ruler under divine
guidance, which could be seen as linking the restoration of the empire
to Christ’s victory.</p>
<h5 id="par:victorinus-of-pettau-c.-250303-ad">10. Victorinus of Pettau
(c. 250–303 AD)</h5>
<p>In his Commentary on the Apocalypse, Victorinus draws connections
between the Roman Empire and the eventual triumph of Christianity. Like
many of his contemporaries, he believes that the empire is part of God’s
plan and that its ultimate transformation into a Christian empire would
bring about the fulfillment of prophecy. This can be seen as a form of
“restoration” through the christianization of the empire.</p>

The revolt is not militaristic Rome chose to spiritually convert to
Christianity, and the Eastern Roman Empire was restored peacefully while
the Christian writers started to praise rome.</h5>
<p>Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) – Expanded In City of God, Augustine
offers a vision where the fall of the Roman Empire is viewed through a
Christian lens. He argues that the decline of the empire does not
indicate the failure of divine providence. While he focuses on the
spiritual aspects of empire, he acknowledges the empire’s role in
preparing the world for the Christian kingdom, suggesting a
“restoration” of the Roman Empire as a Christian entity in the
future.</p>
<h5 id="par:the-shepherd-of-hermas-c.-100-160-ad">12. The Shepherd of
Hermas (c. 100-160 AD)</h5>
<p>Apocalyptic Elements: This early Christian text, written by Hermas,
is a visionary work similar in nature to Revelation. It contains visions
and allegories about the future of the Church and the world. The
Shepherd speaks about the coming of the end times and the restoration of
the Church through repentance and faithfulness, much like how Revelation
portrays the establishment of the New Jerusalem and God’s final victory
over evil. Restoration: Hermas depicts the hope of restoration for the
Church and its ultimate triumph, paralleling Revelation’s theme of the
faithful being vindicated at the end of time.</p>

Clement of Alexandria’s Exhortation to the Greeks (c. 190 AD)</h5>
<p>Apocalyptic Elements: In his writings, Clement combines Christian
eschatology with Greek philosophy, advocating for the return of the
“Logos” and the eventual restoration of humanity to divine harmony.
While not strictly apocalyptic in the sense of a Revelation-style
vision, his vision of the future aligns with the idea of cosmic renewal.
Restoration: Clement’s apocalyptic themes include the eventual
restoration of the world through the Logos, an idea that ties back to
the restoration of divine order similar to the eschatological views
found in Revelation.</p>
<h5 id="par:cyprian-of-carthages-the-lapsed-c.-250-ad">14. Cyprian of
Carthage’s The Lapsed (c. 250 AD)</h5>
<p>Apocalyptic Elements: Cyprian writes about the persecution of
Christians and the imminent return of Christ. His works anticipate the
final judgment, the victory of the righteous, and the establishment of a
divine kingdom. Restoration: Like other early Christian apocalyptic
writers, Cyprian believed that the Church would be restored and triumph
over its persecutors, reflecting the broader apocalyptic hope seen in
Revelation.</p>
