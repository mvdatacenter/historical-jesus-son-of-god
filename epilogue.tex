\paragraph{Epilogue}\label{par:epilogue}

Although the exact theory presented in this book seems quite novel and challenging all the past interpretations of historical Jesus, the author has a feeling some people already knew it all along.

Let's listen to one of the most beautiful and beloved song we sing every Christmas in the English-speaking world for the last 300 years.

``Mild he lays his glory by, born that man no more may die, born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth.
Joyful all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies, with the angelic host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem, Hark!
the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.''
