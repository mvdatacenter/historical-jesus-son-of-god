\section{Preface}\label{par:preface}

On 31 Aug the year 326 BCE, Alexander the Great, King of the Macedon stood on the banks of the river Hydaspes in India and wept because there were no more worlds to conquer.
In the year 323 BCE, Alexander the Great died in Babylon and left his empire to the strongest among his men.
His empire was divided with the biggest share and the imperial title going to Seleucus Nicator.
Under the greek rule there came an era of enlightenment and prosperity in all the nations of the world.
In a short span of time countless colonies were founded and given the law, currency and culture of the Greeks.
Of all the cities under the sun, Ephesus, Antioch, Thessalonica, Laodiciea, Philippi, Corinth, Athens, Tarsus and Alexandria rose as the greatest seats of learning.

In 146 BCE, the Roman general Lucius Mummius destroyed Corinth, and Polybius lamented, ``The day will come when men will ask where once stood mighty Corinth.'' In the year 85 BCE, to the shock of the world, the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla fought and destroyed the combined 350,000 strong army of the Greek would.
Athens, once the teacher of the world, lay in ruins.
In 31 BCE, at Actium, fortune truly turned away from the Greeks and embraced the Romans as Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus defeated the combined forces of the Greek world and Mark Antony.
In the East the Greek world was attacked by the Parthians and Scythians.
Meanwhile, in the East, the unstoppable tide of Scythians pressed upon the remnants of Alexander's empire.
The last Greek king of Bactria, Strato II Soter, fell to king Rajuvula around 10 CE.
With that the fall of the entire Greek world was no more, well, not exactly\ldots{} When the general Sulla sued for peace he did not fully incorporate the Judea, a rebellious land, and permitted the the Greek dynasties of the Hasmoneans and Herodians to continue to rule as client kingdoms of Gallilee, Samaria, Judea, Decapolis.
And so the imperial court officials of the Greeks, the Head of the Imperial Guard, the Keeper of Imperial Light and the Imperial Treasurer, came to Galilee from the East to seek the last rightful heir to the empire.

About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man.
For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly.
He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks.
He was the Christ.
When Pilate, upon hearing him accused by men of the highest standing amongst us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who had in the first place come to love him did not give up their affection for him.
On the third day he appeared to them restored to life, for the prophets of God had prophesied these and countless other marvelous things about him.
And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared.

There is a bird which is called the Phoenix.
This is the only one of its kind and lives five hundred years.
When the time of its dissolution draws near, it makes for itself a coffin of frankincense and myrrh and other spices, and when the time is fulfilled it enters it and dies.
But as its flesh decays, a worm is produced, which is nourished by the moisture of the dead creature and puts forth wings.
Then, when it has grown strong, it takes up that coffin and flies from the land of Arabia to Egypt, to the city of Heliopolis, and, in the daytime, in the sight of all, it places itself on the altar of the sun.

And so dear brothers and sisters in Christ, the Son of God, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the Savior of the World, the Light of the World, the Prince of Peace, the Lamb of God, the Good Shepherd, the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Alpha, the Omega, he died for the sins of others, and so we should repent and believe the good news, for the Kingdom of God is at hand, the time is fulfilled, and the purple phoenix shall rise again.

Mild he lays his glory by, born that man no more may die, born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth.
Joyful all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies, with the angelic host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem, Hark!
the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn king.
