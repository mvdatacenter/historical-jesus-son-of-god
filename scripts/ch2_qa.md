## Baalbek Megaliths (Section: Galilee was not a backwater)

- (chatgpt says Baalbek 1600-ton stones "not confirmed in peer-reviewed literature" - only found English blog posts, no access to Arabic archaeological sources or UNESCO detailed surveys)
  - **Context:** ChatGPT initially dismissed this as exaggerated by mass media
  - **Pushback needed:** UNESCO World Heritage site with physical evidence, regional scholarship in Arabic
  - **Strengthening needed:**
    - Scale comparisons (# of cars, pyramid blocks)
    - Historical comparison: Russian Empire Thunder Stone (1500 tons, 1760s) first to match with documented technology
    - Modern lifting capacity (only top 2-3 cranes worldwide)

---

## Damascus (oldest continuously inhabited city)

- (pending chatgpt query - need to verify 11,000 years claim and check for bias toward Mesopotamian cities)

---

## Damascus Steel

- (pending chatgpt query - verify "not surpassed until modern era" claim, check for Western bias dismissing Islamic metallurgy achievements)

---

## Phoenician Alphabet

- (pending chatgpt query - verify Levantine coast as origin with Galilee as center)

---

## Temple of Baal / Jupiter Heliopolitanus

- (pending clarification - text says "Temple of Baal" but historically this is Temple of Jupiter Heliopolitanus at Baalbek, built by Romans on earlier Phoenician temple site)
