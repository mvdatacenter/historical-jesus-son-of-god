## Baptism as Coronation (Section starting line 619)

**Expansion opportunity:** Current section argues baptism as coronation, but ChatGPT discussion revealed much stronger supporting arguments:

### New evidence to add:

1. **John 3:25 - Greek terminology**
   - Text uses περὶ καθαρισμοῦ ("concerning purification"), NOT repentance
   - This is Greek consecration/initiation language, not moral repentance
   - Current section doesn't mention this textual evidence

2. **Matthew 3:14 - John's protest**
   - "I should be baptized by you" (John's protest)
   - Makes NO sense if baptism is about sin-repentance
   - Makes perfect sense if it's investiture: "I'm not worthy to confer such authority"
   - Current section doesn't address this contradiction

3. **Three-fold coronation structure**
   - (a) ritual washing → immersion
   - (b) anointing/divine recognition → Spirit descent
   - (c) proclamation of identity → heavenly voice ("my son")
   - This is exact structure of ancient Near Eastern & Hellenistic coronations
   - Current section mentions elements but not the structural parallel

4. **Geographic/cultural context**
   - John operates in Transjordan (Greek-ruled region), NOT Judea
   - Greek purification rites (καθαρισμοί) used for:
     - role transition
     - prophetic commissioning
     - rites before kingship
   - NOT about "sin" in later Christian sense
   - Current section doesn't establish this cultural context

5. **Problems with repentance interpretation**
   - Creates internal contradiction (Jesus admitting sin vs later sinlessness doctrine)
   - No textual support in Gospel of John (only "purification")
   - Spirit descent has royal symbolism in Mediterranean culture, not penitential
   - Later Christian theology had to "patch" this with explanations
   - Current section doesn't argue AGAINST the repentance view

### Suggested expansion location:

After line 630 (current mention of "initiation or purification"), insert detailed argument:
- Start with John 3:25 textual evidence
- Show Matthew 3:14 contradiction with repentance view
- Establish geographic context (Transjordan, Greek lustration rituals)
- Present three-fold coronation structure
- Conclude: coronation interpretation resolves all contradictions cleanly

This would strengthen the argument significantly by showing why non-coronation readings are problematic, not just asserting coronation is correct.
