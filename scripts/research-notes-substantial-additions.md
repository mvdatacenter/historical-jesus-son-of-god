# Research Notes: Substantial Additions Candidates (2026-02-16)

These are the 10 items previously proposed. This note now marks which are weak, which are strong, and why.

## Status legend
- KEEP = still useful
- WEAK = low standalone value
- WITHDRAW = poor fit to current argument framing

---

## 1) Gallio anchor for Acts chronology
- Status: KEEP
- Claim: Acts 18 aligns with Gallio's proconsulship (c. 51/52 CE), giving one hard external date for Pauline chronology.
- Why useful: It constrains chronology with non-Christian epigraphic evidence.

## 2) Politarch title epigraphically confirmed
- Status: KEEP
- Claim: Luke's use of "politarchs" in Thessalonica matches local inscriptions.
- Why useful: Independent validation that Acts preserves region-specific administrative vocabulary.

## 3) Nazareth occupied in late Hellenistic / early Roman period
- Status: KEEP
- Claim: Field archaeology supports settlement in Jesus-period horizon.
- Why useful: Strengthens existence/timeline argument without speculative reconstruction.

## 4) Separate "Nazareth existed" from "Nazareth = Sepphoris"
- Status: KEEP
- Claim: Distinguish strong evidence from speculative identification.
- Why useful: Prevents strongest claims from being dragged down by weakest.

## 5) Lord's Prayer doxology text-critical leverage (Didache + Matthew witnesses)
- Status: KEEP (HIGH VALUE)
- Claim:
  - Didache 8 preserves a shorter liturgical doxology form.
  - Early major Matthew witnesses often lack the later fuller ending ("for thine is the kingdom...").
- Why this is powerful:
  - It gives a datable liturgical control point outside later Byzantine harmonization.
  - It helps separate early prayer core from later expansion, which is critical if chapter 3 argues for very early royal-liturgical strata.
  - It lets you argue from transmission history (what text communities actually prayed) rather than from reconstructed theology.
  - It is testable manuscript data, not interpretive rhetoric.

## 6) Theos Hypsistos ambiguity controls
- Status: KEEP
- Claim: Hypsistos inscriptions can be Jewish, pagan, or mixed depending on context.
- Why useful: Prevents over-reading and makes high-level synthesis more defensible.

## 7) 313 vs 380 imperial milestones
- Status: KEEP
- Claim: 313 = toleration; 380 = normative Nicene imperial religion.
- Why useful: Tightens imperial transition timeline and avoids anachronism.

## 8) Constantine + Sol iconography from coins
- Status: KEEP
- Claim: Material numismatic evidence shows continued Sol language in Constantinian phase.
- Why useful: Direct artifact-level support for transition argument (not just literary claim).

## 9) Revolt-wave chronology split (66-73 / 115-117 / 132-136)
- Status: WITHDRAW (for this argument framing)
- Reason withdrawn: Framed too generically and did not engage your specific thesis logic about structural continuity and coordinated imperial stress dynamics.
- Replacement direction: Build a "continuity-under-stress" model instead of a simple chronological segmentation note.

## 10) Administrative continuity despite theological change
- Status: KEEP
- Claim: Institutional forms can persist while doctrinal content shifts.
- Why useful: Core methodological principle for chapter 5 network/governance thesis.

---

## Immediate next step (high-value)
If only one item is prioritized, it should be #5. It creates a hard transmission-history foothold for chapter 3 and allows stronger claims without overreliance on speculative symbolic parallels.


## #5 Concrete data block (text-critical, manuscript-level)

### Matthew 6:13 doxology: attestation profile
- Longer doxology present in many later manuscripts (often Byzantine stream), with minor wording variation.
- Omission is supported by early/strong witnesses frequently listed in critical notes: א (Sinaiticus), B (Vaticanus), D (Bezae), Z, 0170, family 1, some Old Latin/Coptic witnesses, and Origen citations.
- Didache 8 preserves a shorter liturgical ending: effectively "for yours is the power and the glory forever" (without the full later kingdom-power-glory-amen form).

### Why this matters for chapter 3 specifically
- It demonstrates liturgical growth layers in a prayer tradition that your chapter treats as politically and theologically loaded.
- It gives a hard transmission argument: not "what should be there," but "what communities actually transmitted at different stages."
- It allows you to separate:
  1) earliest recoverable prayer core,
  2) early liturgical expansion,
  3) later standardization.

### Practical insertion target
- Add a short subsection after the Lord's Prayer clause analysis in chapter 3:
  "Textual Layering of the Doxology (Matt 6:13 / Didache 8)".
- Keep the claim limited: this evidence proves layering and liturgical expansion; it does not by itself prove a specific Egyptian origin.
