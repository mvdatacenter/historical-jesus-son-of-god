## PRIORITY 3: FLOW PROBLEMS

### Chapter 2: Egyptian Solar Liturgy Too Dense
**Problem:** 60+ lines of dense analysis (117-180) without section breaks
**Fix:** Add internal headings: "The Egyptian Reading," "The Jewish Reading," "Why Egyptian Fits Better"

### Missing Transitions Between Chapters
- [ ] Ch1→Ch2: Need bridging paragraph explaining HOW royal standing was expressed
- [ ] Ch4→Ch5: Need explicit statement connecting gospel reliability to movement spread
- [ ] Ch5 sections on Acts and Paul: Need connecting paragraph

## PRIORITY 4: LOGICAL LEAPS NEEDING MORE SETUP

### "Greek titles used for kings" → "Jesus understood as rival to Caesar"
**Missing:** How did early Christians make this interpretive leap? What sources show they understood the connection?


### "Paul uses military language" → "Paul organizing armed rebellion"
**Missing:** Could military metaphor just be common metaphor? How do we know it indicates actual organization?
