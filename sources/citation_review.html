This view is compelling because it makes sense of the political overtones of kingship language, the symbolic challenge to the Temple, and the Roman decision to crucify him.

FROM FADUS THE PROCURATOR TO FLORUS.
1
UPON the death of king Agrippa, which we have related in the foregoing
book, Claudius Caesar sent Cassius Longinus as successor to Marcus, out
of regard to the memory of king Agrippa, who had often desired of him by
letters, while be was alive, that he would not suffer Marcus to be any
longer president of Syria. But Fadus, as soon as he was come procurator
into Judea, found quarrelsome doings between the Jews that dwelt in Perea,
and the people of Philadelphia, about their borders, at a village called
Mia, that was filled with men of a warlike temper; for the Jews of Perea
had taken up arms without the consent of their principal men, and had destroyed
many of the Philadelphians. When Fadus was informed of this procedure,
it provoked him very much that they had not left the determination of the
matter to him, if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any
wrong, but had rashly taken up arms against them. So he seized upon three
of their principal men, who were also the causes of this sedition, and
ordered them to be bound, and afterwards had one of them slain, whose name
was Hannibal; and he banished the other two, Areram and Eleazar. Tholomy
also, the arch robber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and
slain, but not till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians.
And indeed, from that time, Judea was cleared of robberies by the care
and providence of Fadus. He also at this time sent for the high priests
and the principal citizens of Jerusalem, and this at the command of the
emperor, and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment and
the sacred vestment, which it is customary for nobody but the high priest
to wear, in the tower of Antonia, that it might be under the power of the
Romans, as it had been formerly. Now the Jews durst not contradict what
he had said, but desired Fadus, however, and Longinus, (which la</div>

One proposal equates him with &quot;the Egyptian&quot; mentioned by Josephus , a prophet who led thousands to the Mount of Olives in the 50s CE and promised to bring down Jerusalem&#x27;s walls.
This parallel is attractive because it explains why Rome reacted so harshly and why later Christians might remember him as one who foretold the Temple’s fall.
The difficulty is chronological, since Josephus places the Egyptian two decades too late.
Another variant links Jesus with Judas the Galilean, who led a revolt against Rome at the time of Quirinius&#x27; census in 6 CE and is remembered as the founder of the zealot movement.

FROM THE BANISHMENT OF ARCHELUS TO THE DEPARTURE FROM BABYLON.
1
NOW Cyrenius, a Roman senator, and one who had gone through other
magistracies, and had passed through them till he had been consul, and
one who, on other accounts, was of great dignity, came at this time into
Syria, with a few others, being sent by Caesar to he a judge of that nation,
and to take an account of their substance. Coponius also, a man of the
equestrian order, was sent together with him, to have the supreme power
over the Jews. Moreover, Cyrenius came himself into Judea, which was now
added to the province of Syria, to take an account of their substance,
and to dispose of Archelaus&#x27;s money; but the Jews, although at the beginning
they took the report of a taxation heinously, yet did they leave off any
further opposition to it, by the persuasion of Joazar, who was the son
of Beethus, and high priest; so they, being over-pesuaded by Joazar&#x27;s words,
gave an account of their estates, without any dispute about it. Yet was
there one Judas, a Gaulonite,
of a city whose name was Gamala, who, taking with him Sadduc,
a Pharisee, became zealous to draw them to a revolt, who both said that
this taxation was no better than an introduction to slavery, and exhorted
the nation to assert their liberty; as if they could procure them happiness
and security for what they possessed, and an assured enjoyment of a still
greater good, which was that of the honor and glory they would thereby
acquire for magnanimity. They also said that God would not otherwise be
assisting to them, than upon their joining with one another in such councils
as might be successful, and for their own advantage; and this especially,
if they would set about great exploits, and not grow weary in executing
the same; so men received what they said with pleasure, and this bold attempt
proceeded to a great height. All sorts of misfortunes also sprang from
these men, and the </div>

            <div class="text-box">The mythicist position ranges from total denial of Jesus’ existence to the claim that, even if he lived, nothing of him remains recoverable beneath the myths.
The case rests on two pillars: the lateness and anonymity of the sources, and the density of mythic and literary parallels in the ancient world.
Jesus himself wrote nothing.
The Gospels known to us today are only first implied to exist when Irenaeus, writing in the late second century, describes Marcion&#x27;s activity around 140 CE .
While they are frequently dated to the late first century, the evidence for mid second century dates is strong as well.
First century and early second century writings show no clear references to the Gospels or epistles we know today, and a direct mention would be expected if they already circulated.

cry; neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall
He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, until He send forth judgment
into contention ;
and in His name shall the Gentiles trust.&quot;
7. Such, then, are the first principles of the Gospel: that there is one God,
the Maker of this universe; He who was also announced by the prophets, and who
by Moses set forth the dispensation of the law,-[principles] which proclaim the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and ignore any other God or Father except Him.
So firm is the ground upon which these Gospels rest, that the very heretics
themselves bear witness to them, and, starting from these [documents], each one
of them endeavours to establish his own peculiar doctrine. For the Ebionites,
who use Matthew&#x27;s Gospel
only, are confuted out of this very same, making false suppositions with regard
to the Lord. But Marcion, mutilating that according to Luke, is proved to be a
blasphemer of the only existing God, from those [passages] which he still
retains. Those, again, who separate Jesus from Christ, alleging that Christ
remained impassible, but that it was Jesus who suffered, preferring the Gospel
by Mark, if they read it with a love of truth, may have their errors rectified.
Those, moreover, who follow Valentinus, making copious use of that according to
John, to illustrate their conjunctions, shall be proved to be totally in error
by means of this very Gospel, as I have shown in the first book. Since, then,
our opponents do bear testimony to us, and make use of these [documents], our
proof derived from them is firm and true.
8. It is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number
than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live,
and four principal winds,
while the Church is scattered throughout all the world, and the &quot;pillar and
ground&quot;
of the Church is the G</div>

Chapter I.-The Apostles Did Not
Commence to Preach the Gospel, or to Place Anything on Record, Until They Were
Endowed with the Gifts and Power of the Holy Spirit. They Preached One God
Alone, Maker of Heaven and Earth.
1. WE have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from
those through whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time
proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to
us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar of our faith.
For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before they possessed &quot;perfect
knowledge,&quot; as some do even venture to say, boasting themselves as improvers of
the apostles. For, after our Lord rose from the dead, [the apostles] were
invested with power from on high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them],
were filled from all [His gifts], and had perfect knowledge: they departed to
the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things [sent] from
God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who indeed do all equally
and individually possess the Gospel of God. Matthew also issued a written Gospel
among the Hebrews
in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying
the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and
interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached
by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel
preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned
upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in
Asia.
2. These have all declared to us that there is one God, Creator of heaven and
earth, announced by the law and the prophets; and one Christ the Son of God. If
any one do not agree to these truths, he despises the companions of the Lord;
nay more, he despises Christ Himself the Lord; yea, he despises the Father also,

Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful
to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such
men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of
the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate,
at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to
the cross,
those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared
to them alive again the third day;
as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful
things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him,
are not extinct at this day.

About the same time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder,
and certain shameful practices happened about the temple of Isis that was
at Rome. I will now first take notice of the wicked attempt about the temple
of Isis, and will then give an account of the Jewish affairs. There was
at Rome a woman whose name was Paulina; one who, on account of the dignity
of her ancestors, and by the regular conduct of a virtuous life, had a
great reputation: she was also very rich; and although she was of a beautiful
countenance, and in that flower of her age wherein women are the most gay,
yet did she lead a life of great modesty. She was married to Saturninus,
one that was every way answerable to her in an excellent character. Decius
Mundus fell in love with this woman, who was a man very high in the equestrian
order; and as she was of too great dignity to be caught by presents, and
had already rejected them, though they had been sent in great abundance,
he was still more inflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promised
to give her two hu</div>

And he said to her: Mary, how is it that I see in your face at one time laughter, at another sorrow? And Mary said to Joseph: Because I see two peoples with my eyes; the one weeping and lamenting, and the other rejoicing and exulting. And they came into the middle of the road, and Mary said to him: Take me down from off the ass, for that which is in me presses to come forth. And he took her down from off the ass, and said to her: Whither shall I lead you, and cover your disgrace? For the place is desert.

Scripture
speaks, respecting the place of the Saviour&#x27;s birth — that the Ruler was to come forth from
Bethlehem
— in the following manner:
And you
Bethlehem
, house of Ephrata, are not the least among the thousands of Judah: for out of you shall He come forth unto Me who is to be Ruler in

In the next place he enclosed the atrium which occupied the space leading to the entrances in front of the church. This comprehended, first the court, then the porticos on each side, and lastly the gates of the court. After these, in the midst of the open market-place,  the general entrance-gates, which were of exquisite workmanship, afforded to passers-by on the outside a view of the interior which could not fail to inspire astonishment.

He further enriched it with numberless offerings of inexpressible beauty and various materials — gold, silver, and precious stones, the skillful and elaborate arrangement of which, in regard to their magnitude, number, and variety, we have not leisure at present to describe particularly.

Such, then, are the accounts of Aristobulus and Eratosthenes.

Polycleitus, however, says that the Euphrates does not overflow; for, he says, it flows through large plains; and as for the mountains, some stand at a distance of two thousand stadia from it, but the Cossaean mountains at a distance of scarcely one thousand, which latter are not very high, are not covered very deeply with snow, and do not cause the snow to melt quickly in great quantities; for, he says, the heights of the mountains lie in the region above Ecbatana towards the north, but, in the region towards the south, they split, broaden out, and become much lower, and at the same time most of their waters are received by the Tigris and thus overflow the plains. Now this last assertion is obviously absurd, for the Tigris flows down into the same plains as the Euphrates, and the above-mentioned heights of the mountains have different altitudes, the northern heights being more elevated in some places, whereas the southern broaden out in some places; but the quantity of snow is not determined merely by the heights, but also by their latitudes; and the same mountain has more snow in its northern parts than in its southern, and the snow continues longer in the former than the latter. Now the Tigris receives from the southernmost parts of Armenia, which are

near Babylonia, the water of the melted snows, which is not much, since it comes from the southern side, and this river would therefore be flooded less than the Euphrates; but the Euphrates receives the water from both parts, and not merely from one mountain, but from many, as IÂ made clear in my description of Armenia,⁠</div>

and then makes its exit into the lake Asphaltitis.
[

]
The country also that lies over against this lake hath the same name
of Gennesareth; its nature is wonderful as well as its beauty; its soil
is so fruitful that all sorts of trees can grow upon it, and the inhabitants
accordingly plant all sorts of trees there; for the temper of the air is
so well mixed, that it agrees very well with those several sorts, particularly
walnuts, which require the coldest air, flourish there in vast plenty;
there are palm trees also, which grow best in hot air; fig trees also and
olives grow near them, which yet require an air that is more temperate.
One may call this place the ambition of nature, where it forces those plants
that are naturally enemies to one another to agree together; it is a happy
contention of the seasons, as if every one of them laid claim to this country;
for it not only nourishes different sorts of autumnal fruit beyond men&#x27;s
expectation, but preserves them a great while; it supplies men with the
principal fruits, with grapes and figs continually, during ten months of
the year
19
and the rest of the fruits as they become ripe together through the whole
year; for besides the good temperature of the air, it is also watered from
a most fertile fountain. The people of the country call it Capharnaum.
Some have thought it to be a vein of the Nile, because it produces the
Coracin fish as well as that lake does which is near to Alexandria. The
length of this country extends itself along the banks of this lake that
bears the same name for thirty furlongs, and is in breadth twenty, And
this is the nature of that place.

What exactly is a gospel or *euangelion*?
In the wider Mediterranean, *euangelion* was not originally a Christian word at all but a political one.
In the Greek cities it denoted the proclamation of royal victories or accessions.
Plutarch uses the word for the &quot;good news&quot; brought from the battlefield, and papyri from Egypt (e.g. P.Oxy. 42.3010, AD 9) announce *euangelion* when generals like Germanicus had triumphed.
It was the technical word for victory reports and ruler festivals across the Hellenistic world.

Â For it was neither every kind of fame nor fame from every source that he courted, as Philip did, who plumed himself like a sophist on the power of his oratory, and took care to have the victories of his chariots at Olympia engraved upon his coins;

Â nay, when those about him inquired whether he would be willing to contend in the foot-race at the Olympic games, since he was swift of foot, &quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;if IÂ could have kings as my contestants.&quot;

NOW all those Galileans who, after the taking of Jotapata, had revolted
from the Romans, did, upon the conquest of Taricheae, deliver themselves
up to them again. And the Romans received all the fortresses and the cities,
excepting Gischala and those that had seized upon Mount Tabor; Gamala also,
which is a city ever against Tarichem, but on the other side of the lake,
conspired with them. This city lay Upon the borders of Agrippa&#x27;s kingdom,
as also did Sogana and Scleucia. And these were both parts of Gaulanitis;
for Sogana was a part of that called the Upper Gaulanitis, as was Gamala
of the Lower; while Selcucia was situated at the lake Semechouitis, which
lake is thirty furlongs in breadth, and sixty in length; its marshes reach
as far as the place Daphne, which in other respects is a delicious place,
and hath such fountains as supply water to what is called Little Jordan,
under the temple of the golden calf,
3
where it is sent into Great Jordan. Now Agrippa had united Sogana and Seleucia
by leagues to himself, at the very beginning of the revolt from the Romans;
yet did not Gamala accede to them, but relied upon the difficulty of the
place, which was greater than that of Jotapata, for it was situated upon
a rough ridge of a high mountain, with a kind of neck in the middle: where
it begins to ascend, it lengthens itself, and declines as much downward
before as behind, insomuch that it is like a camel in figure, from whence
it is so named, although the people of the country do not pronounce it
accurately. Both on the side and the face there are abrupt parts divided
from the rest, and ending in vast deep valleys; yet are the parts behind,
where they are joined to the mountain, somewhat easier of ascent than the
other; but then the people belonging to the place have cut an oblique ditch
there, and made that hard to be ascended also. On its acclivity, which
is straight, houses are built, and those very thick and close to one another.

For our forefathers did not only appoint the best of these priests,
and those that attended upon the Divine worship, for that design from the
beginning, but made provision that the stock of the priests should continue
unmixed and pure; for he who is partaker of the priesthood must propagate
of a wife of the same nation, without having any regard to money, or any
other dignities; but he is to make a scrutiny, and take his wife&#x27;s genealogy
from the ancient tables, and procure many witnesses to it.

And this is our practice not only in
Judea
, but wheresoever any body of
men of our nation do live; and even there an exact catalogue of our priests&#x27;
marriages is kept; I mean at
Egypt
and at
Babylon
, or in any other place
of the rest of the habitable earth, whithersoever our priests are scattered;
for they send to
Jerusalem
the ancient names of their parents in writing,
as well as those of their remoter ancestors, and signify who are the witnesses
also. But if any war falls out, such as have fallen out a great many of
them already, when Antiochus Epiphanes made an invasion upon our country,
as also when Pompey the Great and Quintilius Varus did so also, and principally
in the wars that have happened in our own times, those priests that survive
them compose new tables of genealogy out of the old records, and examine
the circumstances of the women that remain; for still they do not admit
of those that have been captives, as suspecting that they had conversation
with some foreigners. But what is the strongest argument of our exact management
in this matter is what I am now going to say, that we have the names of
our high priests from father to son set down in our records for the interval

What matters most is that two different genealogies were copied, recited, and defended in the first generations of the movement.
That only makes sense if Jesus’ status was being asserted in legal and political categories intelligible to courts, synagogues, and city assemblies.
In Judea, pedigrees were not ornamental: priests were admitted or disqualified by documented descent (Ezra--Nehemiah) and Josephus says explicitly that priestly families, including his own, kept their records in public archives.

I cannot hesitate to declare what my feelings compel me to. I suppose, if the Romans had longer delayed in coming against these guilty wretches, the city would have been swallowed up by a chasm, or overwhelmed with a flood, or struck with such thunderbolts as destroyed
Sodom

madness
indeed was the whole people brought to destruction.

war
, and the dearest friends engaged in hand-to-hand conflict with one another, and snatched from each other the most wretched supports of life.
21. Nor would they
believe
that even the dying were without food; but the

would search them while they were expiring, lest any one should feign death while concealing food in his bosom. With mouths gaping for want of food, they stumbled and staggered along like mad dogs, and beat the doors as if they were
drunk
, and in their impotence they would rush into the same houses twice or thrice in one hour.
22. Necessity compelled them to eat anything they could find, and they gathered and devoured things that were not fit even for the filthiest of irrational beasts. Finally they did not abstain even from their girdles and shoes, and they stripped the hides off their shields and devoured them. Some used even wisps of old hay for food, and others gathered stubble and sold the smallest weight of it for four Attic drachmæ.

But let us now return to where the Jew is introduced, speaking of the mother of
Jesus

when she was pregnant she was turned out of doors by the carpenter to whom she had been
betrothed
, as having been guilty of
adultery
, and that she bore a child to a certain soldier named Panthera;
and let us see whether those who have blindly concocted these fables about the
adultery
of the Virgin with Panthera, and her rejection by the carpenter, did not invent these stories to overturn His miraculous conception by the
Holy Ghost
: for they could have falsified the history in a different manner, on account of its extremely miraculous character, and not have admitted, as it were against their will, that
Jesus
was born of no ordinary
human
marriage. It was to be expected, indeed, that those who would not
believe
the miraculous birth of
Jesus
would invent some
falsehood
. And their not doing this in a credible manner, but (their) preserving the fact that it was not by Joseph that the Virgin conceived Jesus, rendered the
falsehood
very palpable to those who can understand and detect such inventions. Is it at all agreeable to reason, that he who dared to do so much for the
human race

That these hostile traditions survived within Origen&#x27;s rebuttal shows that even Christian defenders recognized their opponents were drawing on a strand of dynastic history rather than empty invention.

death; and they prevailed with the king to do so, and advised this out

When Alexandra observed how things went, and that there were small
hopes that she herself should escape the like treatment from Herod, she
changed her behavior to quite the reverse of what might have been expected
from her former boldness, and this after a very indecent manner; for out
of her desire to show how entirely ignorant she was of the crimes laid
against Mariamne, she leaped out of her place, and reproached her daughter
in the hearing of all the people; and cried out that she had been an ill
woman, and ungrateful to her husband, and that her punishment came justly
upon her for such her insolent behavior, for that she had not made proper
returns to him who had been their common benefactor. And when she had for
some time acted after this hypocritical manner, and been so outrageous
as to tear her hair, this indecent and dissembling behavior, as was to
be expected, was greatly condemned by the rest of the spectators, as it
was principally by the poor woman who was to suffer; for at the first she
gave her not a word, nor was discomposed at her peevishness, and only looked
at her, yet did she out of a greatness of soul discover her concern for
her mother&#x27;s offense, and especially for her exposing herself in a manner
so unbecoming her; but as for herself, she went to her death with an unshaken
firmness of mind, and without changing the color of her face, and thereby
evidently discovered the nobility of her descent to the spectators, even
in the last moments of her life.

Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful
to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such
men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of
the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate,
at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to
the cross,
those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared
to them alive again the third day;

things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him,

About the same time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder,
and certain shameful practices happened about the temple of Isis that was
at Rome. I will now first take notice of the wicked attempt about the temple
of Isis, and will then give an account of the Jewish affairs. There was
at Rome a woman whose name was Paulina; one who, on account of the dignity
of her ancestors, and by the regular conduct of a virtuous life, had a
great reputation: she was also very rich; and although she was of a beautiful
countenance, and in that flower of her age wherein women are the most gay,
yet did she lead a life of great modesty. She was married to Saturninus,
one that was every way answerable to her in an excellent character. Decius
Mundus fell in love with this woman, who was a man very high in the equestrian
order; and as she was of too great dignity to be caught by presents, and
had already rejected them, though they had been sent in great abundance,
he was still more inflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promised

CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF TWENTY-TWO YEARS.
FROM FADUS THE PROCURATOR TO FLORUS.
1
UPON the death of king Agrippa, which we have related in the foregoing
book, Claudius Caesar sent Cassius Longinus as successor to Marcus, out
of regard to the memory of king Agrippa, who had often desired of him by
letters, while be was alive, that he would not suffer Marcus to be any
longer president of Syria. But Fadus, as soon as he was come procurator
into Judea, found quarrelsome doings between the Jews that dwelt in Perea,
and the people of Philadelphia, about their borders, at a village called
Mia, that was filled with men of a warlike temper; for the Jews of Perea
had taken up arms without the consent of their principal men, and had destroyed
many of the Philadelphians. When Fadus was informed of this procedure,
it provoked him very much that they had not left the determination of the
matter to him, if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any
wrong, but had rashly taken up arms against them. So he seized upon three
of their principal men, who were also the causes of this sedition, and
ordered them to be bound, and afterwards had one of them slain, whose name
was Hannibal; and he banished the other two, Areram and Eleazar. Tholomy
also, the arch robber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and
slain, but not till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians.
And indeed, from that time, Judea was cleared of robberies by the care
and providence of Fadus. He also at this time sent for the high priests
and the principal citizens of Jerusalem, and this at the command of the
emperor, and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment and
the sacred vestment, which it is customary for nobody but the high priest
to wear, in the tower of Antonia, that it might be under the power of the
Romans, as it had been formerly. Now the Jews durst not contradict what
he had said, but desired Fadus, however, and Longinus, (which la</div>

The administration of Syria was entrusted to Gaius Cestius, the military forces to Corbulo, with the addition of the fifteenth legion from Pannonia under the command of Marius Celsus.⁠
42
Instructions in writing were given to the tetrarchs⁠
43
and kings, the prefects and procurators, and the praetors in charge of the neighbouring provinces, to take their orders from Corbulo, whose powers were raised to nearly the same level as that allowed by the Roman nation to Pompey for the conduct of the Pirate War.⁠

When Paetus returned, with apprehensions of a graver cast, the Caesar contented himself with a jocular reprimand, the wording of which was roughly, that &quot;he was pardoning him on the spot, lest a person with such a tendency to panic might fall ill if his suspense were protracted.&quot;

He reinforced them with the fifth, which through being stationed in Pontus had escaped the disaster; also with the men of the fifteenth, recently brought up, and picked detachments from Illyricum and Egypt; with the whole of </div>

Although brief, this phrasing shows that in the eyes of Roman chroniclers Jesus was remembered as a disruptive political figure, not simply a preacher.
Later still, Lucian of Samosata , writing around 170 AD, mocked Christians for worshiping &quot;the same crucified sophist&quot; and for living by his laws.

That business about his father makes rather good hearing: only you know all about that;--how the old fellow would hang on, though he was past sixty already, till Proteus could stand it no longer, and put a noose about his neck. Well, this began to be talked about; so he passed sentence of banishment on himself, and wandered about from place to place.
It was now that he came across the priests and scribes of the
11
Christians, in Palestine, and picked up their queer creed. I can tell you, he pretty soon convinced them of his superiority; prophet, elder, ruler of the Synagogue--he was everything at once; expounded their books, commented on them, wrote books himself. They took him for a God, accepted his laws, and declared him their president. The Christians, you know, worship a
man
to this day,--the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account. Well, the end of it was that Proteus was arrested and thrown

into prison. This was the very thing to lend an air to his favourite arts of clap-trap and wonder-working; he was now a made man. The Christians took it all very seriously: he was no sooner in prison, than they began trying every means to get him out again,--but without success. Everything else that could be done for him they most devoutly did. They thought of nothing else. Orphans and ancient widows might be seen hanging about the prison from break of day. Their officials bribed the gaolers to let them sleep inside with him. Elegant dinners were conveyed in; their sacred writings were read; and our old friend Peregrine (as he was still called in those days) became for them &quot;the modern Socrates.&quot; In some of the Asiatic

war

22. Necessity compelled them to eat anything they could find, and they gathered and devoured things that were not fit even for the filthiest of irrational beasts. Finally they did not abstain even from their girdles and shoes, and they stripped the hides off their shields and devoured them. Some used even wisps of old hay for food, and others gathered stubble and sold the smallest weight of it for four Attic drachmæ.

The Lord&#x27;s Teaching Through the Twelve Apostles to the Nations.
Chapter 1. The Two Ways; The First Commandment
There are two ways,  one of life and one of death;  but a great difference between the two ways. The way of life, then, is this: First, you shall
love
God  who made you; second, your neighbour as yourself;  and all things whatsoever you would should not occur to you, do not also do to another.  And of these sayings  the teaching is this: Bless those who curse you, and
pray
for your enemies, and
fast
for those who
persecute
you.  For what reward is there, if you
love
those who
love
you? Do not also the
Gentiles
do the same?  But
love
those who
hate
you, and you shall not have an enemy.  Abstain from fleshly and worldly
lusts
.  If someone gives you a blow upon your right cheek, turn to him the other also,  and you shall be
perfect
. If someone impresses you for one mile, go with him two.  If someone takes away your cloak, give him also your coat.  If someone takes from you what is yours, ask it not back,  for indeed you are not able. Give to every one that asks you, and ask it not back;  for the Father wills that to all should be given of our own blessings (free gifts).  Happy is he that gives according to the commandment; for he is guiltless. Woe to him that receives; for if one having need receives, he is guiltless; but he that receives not having need, shall pay the penalty, why he received and for what, and, coming into straits (confinement),  he shall be examined concerning the things which he has done, and he shall not escape thence until he pay back the last farthing.
Matthew 5:26
But also now concerning this, it has been said, Let your
alms
sweat  in your hands, until you
know
to whom you should give.

appointed governor of Judaea. He, not more with the object of doing honour to Tiberius than with
that of vexing the multitude, dedicated some gilt shields in the palace of Herod, in the holy city;
which had no form nor any other forbidden thing represented on them except some necessary
inscription, which mentioned these two facts, the name of the person who had placed them there,
and the person in whose honour they were so placed there. (300) But when the multitude heard
what had been done, and when the circumstance became notorious, then the people, putting
forward the four sons of the king, who were in no respect inferior to the kings themselves, in
fortune or in rank, and his other descendants, and those magistrates who were among them at the
time, entreated him to alter and to rectify the innovation which he had committed in respect of the
shields; and not to make any alteration in their national customs, which had hitherto been
preserved without any interruption, without being in the least degree changed by any king of
emperor. (301) &quot;But when he steadfastly refused this petition (for he was a man of a very inflexible

NOW all those Galileans who, after the taking of Jotapata, had revolted
from the Romans, did, upon the conquest of Taricheae, deliver themselves
up to them again. And the Romans received all the fortresses and the cities,
excepting Gischala and those that had seized upon Mount Tabor; Gamala also,
which is a city ever against Tarichem, but on the other side of the lake,
conspired with them. This city lay Upon the borders of Agrippa&#x27;s kingdom,
as also did Sogana and Scleucia. And these were both parts of Gaulanitis;
for Sogana was a part of that called the Upper Gaulanitis, as was Gamala
of the Lower; while Selcucia was situated at the lake Semechouitis, which
lake is thirty furlongs in breadth, and sixty in length; its marshes reach
as far as the place Daphne, which in other respects is a delicious place,
and hath such fountains as supply water to what is called Little Jordan,
under the temple of the golden calf,
3
where it is sent into Great Jordan. Now Agrippa had united Sogana and Seleucia
by leagues to himself, at the very beginning of the revolt from the Romans;
yet did not Gamala accede to them, but relied upon the difficulty of the
place, which was greater than that of Jotapata, for it was situated upon
a rough ridge of a high mountain, with a kind of neck in the middle: where
it begins to ascend, it lengthens itself, and declines as much downward
before as behind, insomuch that it is like a camel in figure, from whence
it is so named, although the people of the country do not pronounce it
accurately. Both on the side and the face there are abrupt parts divided
from the rest, and ending in vast deep valleys; yet are the parts behind,
where they are joined to the mountain, somewhat easier of ascent than the
other; but then the people belonging to the place have cut an oblique ditch
there, and made that hard to be ascended also. On its acclivity, which
is straight, houses are built, and those very thick and close to one another.

Many men have been prepared to enter upon still more shameful bargains: to betray friends in order to live longer themselves, or voluntarily to debase their children and so enjoy the light of day which is witness of all their sins. We must get rid of this craving for life, and learn that it makes no difference when your suffering comes, because at some time you are bound to suffer. The point is, not how long you live, but how nobly you live. And often this living nobly means that you cannot live long. Farewell.

            <div class="text-box">The spear thrust appears only in the Gospel of John, and its absence from the Synoptics is a critical contradiction in the death narrative.
Mark, Matthew, and Luke end the crucifixion without any piercing of Jesus&#x27; side, and they provide no scene where soldiers verify death with a weapon.
John introduces the spear later and uses it to assert that blood and water flowed out, which functions as an apologetic gesture to prove Jesus was unquestionably dead.
This addition mirrors Matthew&#x27;s introduction of guards at the tomb, and both serve as narrative devices to counter early claims that Jesus had been removed alive.
The Synoptic silence preserves the earlier tradition, and John&#x27;s spear thrust reads as a later interpretive intervention rather than as an original detail.

22 Then the sun shone forth, and it was found to be the ninth 23 hour. And
the Jews rejoiced, and gave his body unto Joseph to bury it, because he had
beheld all the good things which 24 he did. And he took the Lord and washed him
and wrapped him in linen and brought him unto his own sepulchre, which is called
the Garden of Joseph.
VII. 25 Then the Jews and the elders and the priests, when they perceived how
great evil they had done themselves, began to lament and to say: Woe unto our
sins: the judgement and the end of Jerusalem is drawn nigh.
26 But I with my fellows was in grief, and we were wounded in our minds and
would have hid ourselves; for we were sought after by them as malefactors, and
as thinking to set 27 the temple on fire. And beside all these things we were
fasting, and we sat mourning and weeping night and day until the Sabbath.
VIII. 28 But the scribes and Pharisees and elders gathered one with another,
for they had heard that all the people were murmuring and beating their breasts,
saying: If these very great signs have come to pass at his death, behold how 29
righteous he was. And the elders were afraid and came unto 30 Pilate, entreating
him and saying: Give us soldiers that we (or they) may watch his sepulchre for
three days, lest his disciples come and steal him away and the people suppose 31
that he is risen from the dead, and do us hurt. And Pilate gave them Petronius
the centurion with soldiers to watch the sepulchre; and the elders and scribes
came with them unto 32 the tomb, and when they had rolled a great stone to keep
out (al. together with) the centurion and the soldiers, then all 33 that were
there together set it upon the door of the tomb; and plastered thereon seven
seals; and they pitched a tent there and kept watch.
IX. 34 And early in the morning as the Sabbath dawned, there came a multitude
from Jerusalem and the region roundabout to see the sepulchre that had been
sealed.

Roman crucifixion victims were, as a rule, left on the cross to be eaten by scavengers.
However, even Philo of Alexandria, featured in many discussions in this book for unrelated reasons, described a case of numerous Jew insurrectionists in Alexandria in 38AD were actually taken down from the cross in exchange for a bribe.
It is not completely clear from the text, but the more plausible reading is that some of the victims may have been taken down from the cross before they died.
In this light it should not be considered as implausible that a member of the Sanhedrin would have been able to bargain with the centurion to convince Pilate Jesus already died.

Women serve as the discoverers not because they enhance the story but because they belonged to the circle that handled burial tasks, and their presence reflects halakhic realism rather than literary strategy.
If the narrative were a fabrication, male disciples would receive the revelation, but the text preserves the embarrassing detail because the tradition demanded it.
Claims that Jesus would have been buried in a common grave ignore the political context in which elite Jewish figures could intervene in crucifixions.

NOW it came to pass, while Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a
certain magician, whose name was Theudas,
14
persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them, and
follow him to the river Jordan; for he told them he was a prophet, and
that he would, by his own command, divide the river, and afford them an
easy passage over it; and many were deluded by his words. However, Fadus
did not permit them to make any advantage of his wild attempt, but sent
a troop of horsemen out against them; who, falling upon them unexpectedly,
slew many of them, and took many of them alive. They also took Theudas
alive, and cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem. This was what
befell the Jews in the time of Cuspius Fadus&#x27;s government.

Then came Tiberius Alexander as successor to Fadus; he was the son
of Alexander the alabarch of Alexandria, which Alexander was a principal
person among all his contemporaries, both for his family and wealth: he
was also more eminent for his piety than this his son Alexander, for he
did not continue in the religion of his country. Under these procurators
that great famine happened in Judea, in which queen Helena bought corn
in Egypt at a great expense, and distributed it to those that were in want,
as I have related already. And besides this, the sons of Judas of Galilee
were now slain; I mean of that Judas who caused the people to revolt, when
Cyrenius came to take an account of the estates of the Jews, as we have
showed in a foregoing book. The names of those sons were James and Simon,
whom Alexander commanded to be crucified. But now Herod, king of Chalcis,
removed Joseph, the son of Camydus, from the high priesthood, and made
Ananias, the son of Nebedeu, his successor. And now it was that Cumanus

NOW Cyrenius, a Roman senator, and one who had gone through other
magistracies, and had passed through them till he had been consul, and
one who, on other accounts, was of great dignity, came at this time into
Syria, with a few others, being sent by Caesar to he a judge of that nation,
and to take an account of their substance. Coponius also, a man of the
equestrian order, was sent together with him, to have the supreme power
over the Jews. Moreover, Cyrenius came himself into Judea, which was now
added to the province of Syria, to take an account of their substance,
and to dispose of Archelaus&#x27;s money; but the Jews, although at the beginning
they took the report of a taxation heinously, yet did they leave off any
further opposition to it, by the persuasion of Joazar, who was the son
of Beethus, and high priest; so they, being over-pesuaded by Joazar&#x27;s words,
gave an account of their estates, without any dispute about it. Yet was
there one Judas, a Gaulonite,
of a city whose name was Gamala, who, taking with him Sadduc,
a Pharisee, became zealous to draw them to a revolt, who both said that
this taxation was no better than an introduction to slavery, and exhorted
the nation to assert their liberty; as if they could procure them happiness
and security for what they possessed, and an assured enjoyment of a still
greater good, which was that of the honor and glory they would thereby
acquire for magnanimity. They also said that God would not otherwise be
assisting to them, than upon their joining with one another in such councils
as might be successful, and for their own advantage; and this especially,
if they would set about great exploits, and not grow weary in executing
the same; so men received what they said with pleasure, and this bold attempt
proceeded to a great height. All sorts of misfortunes also sprang from

NOW the necessity which Archelaus was under of taking a journey to
Rome was the occasion of new disturbances; for when he had mourned for
his father seven days,

and had given a very expensive funeral feast to the multitude, (which custom
is the occasion of poverty to many of the Jews, because they are forced
to feast the multitude; for if any one omits it, he is not esteemed a holy
person,) he put on a white garment, and went up to the temple, where the
people accosted him with various acclamations. He also spake kindly to
the multitude from an elevated seat and a throne of gold, and returned
them thanks for the zeal they had shown about his father&#x27;s funeral, and
the submission they had made to him, as if he were already settled in the
kingdom; but he told them withal, that he would not at present take upon
him either the authority of a king, or the names thereto belonging, until
Caesar, who is made lord of this whole affair by the testament, confirm
the succession; for that when the soldiers would have set the diadem on
his head at Jericho, he would not accept of it; but that he would make
abundant requitals, not to the soldiers only, but to the people, for their
alacrity and good-will to him, when the superior lords [the Romans] should
have given him a complete title to the kingdom; for that it should be his
study to appear in all things better than his father.

Upon this the multitude were pleased, and presently made a trial
of what he intended, by asking great things of him; for some made a clamor
that he would ease them in their taxes; others, that he would take off
the duties upon commodities; and some, that he would loose those that were
in prison; in all which cases he answered readily to their satisfaction,
in order to get the good-will of the multitude; after which he offered

But when Hyrcanus had put an end to this sedition, he after that
lived happily, and administered the government in the best manner for thirty-one
years, and then died,

leaving behind him five sons. He was esteemed by God worthy of three of
the greatest privileges, - the government of his nation, the dignity of
the high priesthood, and prophecy; for God was with him, and enabled him
to know futurities; and to foretell this in particular, that, as to his
two eldest sons, he foretold that they would not long continue in the government
of public affairs; whose unhappy catastrophe will be worth our description,

NOW when their father Hyrcanus was dead, the eldest son Aristobulus,
intending to change the government into a kingdom, for so he resolved to
do, first of all put a diadem on his head, four hundred eighty and one
years and three months after the people had been delivered from the Babylonish
slavery, and were returned to their own country again. This Aristobulus
loved his next brother Antigonus, and treated him as his equal; but the
others he held in bonds. He also cast his mother into prison, because she
disputed the government with him; for Hyrcanus had left her to be mistress
of all. He also proceeded to that degree of barbarity, as to kill her in
prison with hunger; nay, he was alienated from his brother Antigonus by
calumnies, and added him to the rest whom he slew; yet he seemed to have
an affection for him, and made him above the rest a partner with him in
the kingdom. Those calumnies he at first did not give credit to, partly
because he loved him, and so did not g</div>

WHEN Aristobulus was dead, his wife Salome, who, by the Greeks, was
called Alexandra, let his brethren out of prison, (for Aristobulus had
kept them in bonds, as we have said already,) and made Alexander Janneus
king, who was the superior in age and in moderation. This child happened
to be hated by his father as soon as he was born, and could never be permitted
to come into his father&#x27;s sight till he died.
43
The occasion of which hatred is thus reported: when Hyrcanus chiefly loved
the two eldest of his sons, Antigonus and Aristobutus, God appeared to
him in his sleep, of whom he inquired which of his sons should be his successor.
Upon God&#x27;s representing to him the countenance of Alexander, he was grieved
that he was to be the heir of all his goods, and suffered him to be brought
up in Galilee However, God did not deceive Hyrcanus; for after the death
of Aristobulus, he certainly took the kingdom; and one of his brethren,
who affected the kingdom, he slew; and the other, who chose to live a private
and quiet life, he had in esteem.

When Alexander Janneus had settled the government in the manner that

CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF TWENTY-TWO YEARS.
FROM FADUS THE PROCURATOR TO FLORUS.
1
UPON the death of king Agrippa, which we have related in the foregoing
book, Claudius Caesar sent Cassius Longinus as successor to Marcus, out
of regard to the memory of king Agrippa, who had often desired of him by
letters, while be was alive, that he would not suffer Marcus to be any
longer president of Syria. But Fadus, as soon as he was come procurator
into Judea, found quarrelsome doings between the Jews that dwelt in Perea,
and the people of Philadelphia, about their borders, at a village called
Mia, that was filled with men of a warlike temper; for the Jews of Perea
had taken up arms without the consent of their principal men, and had destroyed
many of the Philadelphians. When Fadus was informed of this procedure,
it provoked him very much that they had not left the determination of the
matter to him, if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any
wrong, but had rashly taken up arms against them. So he seized upon three
of their principal men, who were also the causes of this sedition, and
ordered them to be bound, and afterwards had one of them slain, whose name
was Hannibal; and he banished the other two, Areram and Eleazar. Tholomy
also, the arch robber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and
slain, but not till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians.
And indeed, from that time, Judea was cleared of robberies by the care
and providence of Fadus. He also at this time sent for the high priests
and the principal citizens of Jerusalem, and this at the command of the
emperor, and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment and
the sacred vestment, which it is customary for nobody but the high priest
to wear, in the tower of Antonia, that it might be under the power of the
Romans, as it had been formerly. Now the Jews durst not contradict what
he had said, but desired Fadus, however, and Longinus, (which la</div>

Chapter 12. God Cannot Be Embraced in Words or by the Mind
For both is it a difficult task to discover the Father and Maker of this
universe
; and having found Him, it is impossible to declare Him to all. For this is by no means capable of expression, like the other subjects of instruction,
says the truth-loving
Plato
. For he that had heard right well that the all-wise
Moses
, ascending the mount for
holy
contemplation
, to the summit of intellectual objects, necessarily commands that the whole people do not accompany him. And when the
Scripture
says,
Moses
entered into the thick darkness where God was,
this shows to those capable of understanding, that God is invisible and beyond expression by words. And
the darkness
— which is, in
truth
, the unbelief and
ignorance
of the multitude — obstructs the gleam of
truth
. And again Orpheus, the theologian, aided from this quarter, says:—
One is perfect in himself, and all things are made the progeny of one,
or,
are born;
for so also is it written. He adds:—
Him
No one of mortals has seen, but He sees all.
And he adds more clearly:—
Him see I not, for round about, a cloud
Has settled; for in mortal eyes are small,
And mortal pupils — only flesh and bones grow there.
To these statements the apostle will testify:

to Vitellius to make war upon him, and either to take him alive, and bring

Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod&#x27;s army
came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against
John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man,
and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards
one another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that
the washing [with water] would be acceptable to him, if they made use of
it, not in order to the putting away [or the remission] of some sins [only],
but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was
thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. Now when [many] others
came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased]
by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had
over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a
rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought
it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause,
and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make
him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner,
out of Herod&#x27;s suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I before mentioned,
and was there put to death. Now the Jews had an opinion that the destruction
of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and a mark of God&#x27;s displeasure
to him.

The concept of Logos was a central theme debated across various philosophical schools, including Heraclitus, who first introduced it as a principle of order and knowledge, the Stoics who saw it as the rational structure of the universe, and the Middle Platonists who integrated it into their metaphysical systems.
This widespread philosophical discourse permeated popular rhetoric, setting the stage for Philo of Alexandria’s interpretations.

FROM THE BANISHMENT OF ARCHELUS TO THE DEPARTURE FROM BABYLON.

NOW Cyrenius, a Roman senator, and one who had gone through other
magistracies, and had passed through them till he had been consul, and
one who, on other accounts, was of great dignity, came at this time into
Syria, with a few others, being sent by Caesar to he a judge of that nation,
and to take an account of their substance. Coponius also, a man of the
equestrian order, was sent together with him, to have the supreme power
over the Jews. Moreover, Cyrenius came himself into Judea, which was now
added to the province of Syria, to take an account of their substance,
and to dispose of Archelaus&#x27;s money; but the Jews, although at the beginning
they took the report of a taxation heinously, yet did they leave off any
further opposition to it, by the persuasion of Joazar, who was the son
of Beethus, and high priest; so they, being over-pesuaded by Joazar&#x27;s words,
gave an account of their estates, without any dispute about it. Yet was
there one Judas, a Gaulonite,
of a city whose name was Gamala, who, taking with him Sadduc,
a Pharisee, became zealous to draw them to a revolt, who both said that
this taxation was no better than an introduction to slavery, and exhorted
the nation to assert their liberty; as if they could procure them happiness
and security for what they possessed, and an assured enjoyment of a still
greater good, which was that of the honor and glory they would thereby
acquire for magnanimity. They also said that God would not otherwise be
assisting to them, than upon their joining with one another in such councils
as might be successful, and for their own advantage; and this especially,
if they would set about great exploits, and not grow weary in executing
the same; so men received what they said with pleasure, and this bold attempt
proceeded to a great height. All sorts of misfortunes also sprang from
these men, and the </div>

Whether or not any personal meeting occurred, the conceptual language of Logos was available to anyone moving through this aristocratic network.
Notably in the context of the greek empire, the Logos was a divine principle that was both God’s expression and as such the ruler would have been considered to speak the Logos of the God.

where he says, &quot;Ye are the sons of the Lord God.&quot;{41}{#de 14:1.} And again, &quot;God who begot
Thee;&quot;{42}{#de 32:18.} and in another place, &quot;Is not he thy father?&quot; Accordingly, it is natural for
those who have this disposition of soul to look upon nothing as beautiful except what is good, which
is the citadel erected by those who are experienced in this kind of warfare as a defence against
the end of pleasure, and as a means of defeating and destroying it. (146) And even if there be not
as yet any one who is worthy to be called a son of God, nevertheless let him labour earnestly to be
adorned according to his first-born word, the eldest of his angels, as the great archangel of many
names; for he is called, the authority, and the name of God, and the Word, and man according to
God&#x27;s image, and he who sees Israel. (147) For which reason I was induced a little while ago to
praise the principles of those who said, &quot;We are all one man&#x27;s Sons.&quot;{43}{#ge 42:11.} For even if
we are not yet suitable to be called the sons of God, still we may deserve to be called the children
of his eternal image, of his most sacred word; for the image of God is his most ancient word. (148)
And, indeed, in many passages of the law, the children of Israel are called hearers of him that
seeth, since hearing is honoured with the second rank next after the sense of sight, and since that
which is in need of instruction is at all times second to that which can receive clear impressions of
the subjects submitted to it without any such information. (149) And I also admire the things which
are spoken under divine inspiration in the books of Kings, according to which those who flourished
many generations afterwards and lived in a blameless manner, are spoken of as the sons of David
who wrote hymns to God; {44}{2 Ezr. 8:2.} though, during his lifetime, even their great grandfathers had
not yet been born. The</div>

Notably, the Jewish Day of Atonement, where the sins of the people are taken away, refers to the quintessential Egyptian idea of the Book of the Dead and the Book of the Living.
But while admittedly while the Jewish parallel here is possible, the Egyptian parallel is much more direct and explicit.
Amun, the hidden father, was also portrayed as a ram or lamb.

CHAP. 60. (43.)—A SEDITION THAT AROSE AMONG THE ROMAN
PEOPLE, IN CONSEQUENCE OF A RAVEN SPEAKING.
Let us do justice, also, to the raven, whose merits have been
attested not only by the sentiments of the Roman people, but
by the strong expression, also, of their indignation. In the
reign of Tiberius, one of a brood of ravens that had bred on
the top of the temple of Castor,
170
happened to fly into a shoemaker&#x27;s shop that stood opposite: upon which, from a feeling
of religious veneration, it was looked upon as doubly recommended by the owner of the place. The bird, having been
taught to speak at an early age, used every morning to fly to
the Rostra, which look towards the Forum; here, addressing
each by his name, it would salute Tiberius, and then the
Cæsars
171
Germanicus and Drusus, after which it would proceed to greet the Roman populace as they passed, and then return to the shop: for several years it was remarkable for the
constancy of its attendance. The owner of another shoemaker&#x27;s
shop in the neighbourhood, in a sudden fit of anger killed the
bird, enraged, as he would have had it appear, because with its
ordure it had soiled some shoes of his. Upon this, there was
such rage manifested by the multitude, that he was at once
driven from that part of the city, and soon after put to death.
The funeral, too, of the bird was celebrated with almost endless obsequies; the body was placed upon a litter carried upon
the shoulders of two Æthiopians, preceded by a piper, and
borne to the pile with garlands of every size and description.
The pile was erected on the right-hand side of the Appian

of whom he was the shepherd; neither was there any violence, or devouring
of one another or war or quarrel among them; and I might tell of ten thousand
other blessings, which belonged to that dispensation. The reason why the
life of man was, as tradition says, spontaneous, is as follows: In those
days God himself was their shepherd, and ruled over them, just as man,
over them, who is by comparison a divine being, still rules over the lower
animals. Under him there were no forms of government or separate possession
of women and children; for all men rose again from the earth, having no
memory, of the past. And although they had nothing of this sort, the earth
gave them fruits in abundance, which grew on trees and shrubs unbidden,
and were not planted by the hand of man. And they dwelt naked, and mostly
in the open air, for the temperature of their seasons, was mild; and they
had no beds, but lay on Soft couches of grass, which grew plentifully out
of: the earth. Such was the life of man in the days of Cronos, Socrates;
the character of our present life which is said to be under Zeus, you know
from your own experience. Can you, and will you, determine which of them
you deem the happier?

Suppose that the nurslings of Cronos, having this boundless
leisure, and the power of holding intercourse, not only with men, but with
the brute creation, had used all these advantages with a view to philosophy,
conversing with the brutes as well as with one another, and learning of
every nature which was gifted with any special power, and was able to contribute
some special experience to the store of wisdom there would be no difficulty
in deciding that they would be a thousand times happier than the men of
our own day. Or, again, if they had merely eaten and drunk until they were

underground den which is open towards the light; they have been there from
childhood, having their necks and legs chained, and can only see into the den.
At a distance there is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners a raised
way, and a low wall is built along the way, like the screen over which
marionette players show their puppets. Behind the wall appear moving figures,
who hold in their hands various works of art, and among them images of men and
animals, wood and stone, and some of the passers-by are talking and others
silent. ‘A strange parable,’ he said, ‘and strange
captives.’ They are ourselves, I replied; and they see only the shadows
of the images which the fire throws on the wall of the den; to these they give
names, and if we add an echo which returns from the wall, the voices of the
passengers will seem to proceed from the shadows. Suppose now that you suddenly
turn them round and make them look with pain and grief to themselves at the
real images; will they believe them to be real? Will not their eyes be dazzled,
and will they not try to get away from the light to something which they are
able to behold without blinking? And suppose further, that they are dragged up
a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself, will not their
sight be darkened with the excess of light? Some time will pass before they get
the habit of perceiving at all; and at first they will be able to perceive only
shadows and reflections in the water; then they will recognize the moon and the
stars, and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he is. Last

Â Mucianus, bearing himself rather as a
Â p295Â
partner in empire than as a subordinate, advanced with a force in light marching order, not indeed slowly, for fear of seeming to hesitate, nor yet in haste, for he wished to let distance increase his renown, being well aware that he had only moderate forces at his disposal and conscious that men magnify what is far away. Yet the Sixth legion and thirteen thousand veterans followed after him in imposing array. He had directed the fleet in the Black Sea to concentrate at Byzantium, for he was undecided whether he should not leave Moesia to one side and occupy Dyrrachium with his foot and horse, establishing meantime a blockade in the waters around Italy with his ships-ofâwar. In that way he would protect Achaia and Asia in his rear, whereas they would be without protection and exposed to Vitellius, unless he left forces to guard them. He believed also that Vitellius himself would be at a loss what part of Italy to protect if he prepared to attack with his fleet Brundisium, Tarentum, and the coasts of Calabria and Lucania.

Sulpicius straightway brought forward a law for this purpose. If it were enacted Marius and Sulpicius would have everything they wanted, because the new citizens far outnumbered the old ones. The old citizens saw this and opposed the new ones with all their might. They fought each other with sticks and stones, and the evil increased continually, till the consuls, becoming apprehensive, as the day for voting on the law drew near, proclaimed a vacation⁠

of the young plants till the fourth year, before which the fruit may not be
picked (155-159). Plants, animals, menfrom consideration of the lowest we
rise to consideration for the highest (160).
All these injunctions are levelled against the vice of pride or arrogance
(161-164) which Moses denounces when he bids us use all gifts &quot;to make
power,&quot; that is to promote the same powers in others (165-170), and also
tells us that God is &quot;provoked by the presumptuousness&quot; which thinks
itself divine, ascribes to itself all virtues and gifts and denies them to
all others (171-174).
Repentance
In this short sermon the value of repentance as the &quot;second best&quot;
is insisted on, as shown primarily in those who are converted from idolatry
and must be treated with all friendliness (175-179) and in general by passing
from disobedience to obedience to the law which is not far off but in our
&quot;mouth, hand and heart&quot; (180-184), and by &quot;choosing&quot; God,
a choice which makes each single man his people (185-186).
Nobility
The first part of this treatise is a discussion of the theme that the truly
well-born or noble is the wise man, and the truly ignoble or ill-born the
fool, as shown by the fact that the possession of gifted and virtuous ancestors
does not benefit us if we do not inherit those gifts or follow those virtues
(187-197). This is illustrated from Genesis, first, by degenerate sons of
good parents. Adam was nobly born yet begat Cain (198-200); Noah begat Ham
(201-202), indeed Adam himself was the son of God but fell (203-205). These
belong to mankind in general. In Jewish history we find that Abraham&#x27;s sons
except Isaac were of little worth (206-207), and Esau was the son of Isaac
(208-210). Secondly, by good children of bad or inferior parentage. Abraham&#x27;s
parents were astrologers and idolaters; yet how wonderful was his life and
personality (211-219); and so with women also. Tamar who cam</div>

was very ill taken by Agrippa, who after that became his enemy. And now
he took the high priesthood away from Matthias, and made Elioneus, the
son of Cantheras, high priest in his stead.
[

]
Now when Agrippa had reigned three years over all Judea, he came
to the city Cesarea, which was formerly called Strato&#x27;s Tower; and there
he exhibited shows in honor of Caesar, upon his being informed that there
was a certain festival celebrated to make vows for his safety. At which
festival a great multitude was gotten together of the principal persons,
and such as were of dignity through his province. On the second day of
which shows he put on a garment made wholly of silver, and of a contexture
truly wonderful, and came into the theater early in the morning; at which
time the silver of his garment being illuminated by the fresh reflection
of the sun&#x27;s rays upon it, shone out after a surprising manner, and was
so resplendent as to spread a horror over those that looked intently upon
him; and presently his flatterers cried out, one from one place, and another
from another, (though not for his good,) that he was a god; and they added,
&quot;Be thou merciful to us; for although we have hitherto reverenced
thee only as a man, yet shall we henceforth own thee as superior to mortal
nature.&quot; Upon this the king did neither rebuke them, nor reject their
impious flattery. But as he presently afterward looked up, he saw an owl
30
sitting on a certain rope over his head, and immediately understood that
this bird was the messenger of ill tidings, as it had once been the messenger
of good tidings to him; and fell into the deepest sorrow. A severe pain
also arose in his belly, and began in a most violent manner. He therefore
looked upon his friends, and said, &quot;I, whom you call a god, am commanded
presently to depart this life; while Providence thus reproves the lying

The loss of political sovereignty is directly attributed to collective hamartia, and the hope for restoration rests on divine intervention following national reformation.
This same pattern appears in the Dead Sea Scrolls, in the prayers of the Community Rule and the Damascus Document, where the sectarians at Qumran frame Roman domination as God&#x27;s punishment for the sins of the Jerusalem priesthood and the broader Jewish people.

These
dove-courts in Josephus, built by Herod the Great, are, in the opinion
of Reland, the very same that are mentioned by the Talmudists, and named
by them &quot;Herod&#x27;s dove courts.&quot; Nor is there any reason to suppose
otherwise, since in both accounts they were expressly tame pigeons which
were kept in them.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE TEMPLE.
18
See the
description of the temples hereto belonging, ch. 15. But note, that what
Josephus here says of the original scantiness of this Mount Moriah, that
it was quite too little for the temple, and that at first it held only
one cloister or court of Solomon&#x27;s building, and that the foundations were
forced to be added long afterwards by degrees, to render it capable of
the cloisters for the other courts, etc., is without all foundation in
the Scriptures, and not at all confirmed by his exacter account in the
Antiquities. All that is or can be true here is this, that when the court
of the Gentiles was long afterward to be encompassed with cloisters, the
southern foundation for these cloisters was found not to be large or firm
enough, and was raised, and that additional foundation supported by great
pillars and arches under ground, which Josephus speaks of elsewhere, Antiq.
B. XV. ch. 11. sect. 3, and which Mr. Maundrel saw, and describes, p. 100,
as extant under ground at this day.
19
What Josephus
seems here to mean is this: that these pillars, supporting the cloisters
in the second court, had their foundations or lowest parts as deep as the
floor of the first or lowest court; but that so far of those lowest parts
as were equal to the elevation of the upper floor above the lowest were,
and must be, hidden on the inside by the ground or rock </div>

The Greek word ἁμαρτία (hamartia), typically translated ``sin,&#x27;&#x27; carries this collective-political dimension throughout Hellenistic Greek literature.
In classical Greek, hamartia meant ``missing the mark&#x27;&#x27; or ``error,&#x27;&#x27; especially errors in judgment---Aristotle uses it in the Poetics (1453a) for the tragic flaw or misjudgment that brings down a hero.

            <div class="text-box snippet-box">[part2.txt] neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear
by the misfortune of a man like ourselves. Such an event, therefore, will
be neither pitiful nor terrible. There remains, then, the character between
these two extremes- that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet
whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some
error or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous-
a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such
families.
A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue,
rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not
from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about
as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character
either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. The practice
of the stage bears out our view. At first the poets recounted any legend
that came in their way. Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story
of a few houses- on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager,
Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done  or suffered something
terrible. A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art
should be of this construction. Hence they are in error who censure Euripides
just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end
unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is
that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked
out, are the most tragic in effect; and Euripides, faulty though he may
be in the general management of his subject, yet is felt to be the most
tragic of the poets.
In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first.
Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite
catastrophe for the good and for the bad. It is accounted the best because
of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in w</div>

This is exactly a modern perspective Philo would have embraced, and it is very likely that the author of John was trying to convey the same message.
Justin Martyr accuses followers of Mithras of copying Christian rites, which he attributes to demonic imitation .
This polemical claim indicates that by the mid-second century, Christian Eucharistic practice was publicly recognizable enough to invite comparison with mystery-cult meals.

Chapter I.-The Apostles Did Not
Commence to Preach the Gospel, or to Place Anything on Record, Until They Were
Endowed with the Gifts and Power of the Holy Spirit. They Preached One God
Alone, Maker of Heaven and Earth.
1. WE have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from
those through whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time
proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to
us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar of our faith.
For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before they possessed &quot;perfect
knowledge,&quot; as some do even venture to say, boasting themselves as improvers of
the apostles. For, after our Lord rose from the dead, [the apostles] were
invested with power from on high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them],
were filled from all [His gifts], and had perfect knowledge: they departed to
the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things [sent] from
God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who indeed do all equally
and individually possess the Gospel of God. Matthew also issued a written Gospel
among the Hebrews
in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying
the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and
interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached
by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel
preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned
upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in
Asia.
2. These have all declared to us that there is one God, Creator of heaven and
earth, announced by the law and the prophets; and one Christ the Son of God. If
any one do not agree to these truths, he despises the companions of the Lord;
nay more, he despises Christ Himself the Lord; yea, he despises the Father also,

resemble each of the incorporeal ideas. (19) Now we must form a somewhat similar opinion of
God, who, having determined to found a mighty state, first of all conceived its form in his mind,
according to which form he made a world perceptible only by the intellect, and then completed one
visible to the external senses, using the first one as a model.
V. (20) As therefore the city, when previously shadowed out in the mind of the man of architectural
skill had no external place, but was stamped solely in the mind of the workman, so in the same
manner neither can the world which existed in ideas have had any other local position except the
divine reason which made them; for what other place could there be for his powers which should be
able to receive and contain, I do not say all, but even any single one of them whatever, in its simple
form? (21) And the power and faculty which could be capable of creating the world, has for its
origin that good which is founded on truth; for if any one were desirous to investigate the cause on
account of which this universe was created, I think that he would come to no erroneous conclusion
if he were to say as one of the ancients did say: &quot;That the Father and Creator was good; on which
account he did not grudge the substance a share of his own excellent nature, since it had nothing
good of itself, but was able to become everything.&quot; (22) For the substance was of itself destitute of
arrangement, of quality, of animation, of distinctive character, and full of all disorder and confusion;
and it received a change and transformation to what is opposite to this condition, and most
excellent, being invested with order, quality, animation, resemblance, identity, arrangement,
harmony, and everything which belongs to the more excellent idea.

Thee;&quot;{42}{#de 32:18.} and in another place, &quot;Is not he thy father?&quot; Accordingly, it is natural for
those who have this disposition of soul to look upon nothing as beautiful except what is good, which
is the citadel erected by those who are experienced in this kind of warfare as a defence against
the end of pleasure, and as a means of defeating and destroying it. (146) And even if there be not
as yet any one who is worthy to be called a son of God, nevertheless let him labour earnestly to be
adorned according to his first-born word, the eldest of his angels, as the great archangel of many
names; for he is called, the authority, and the name of God, and the Word, and man according to
God&#x27;s image, and he who sees Israel. (147) For which reason I was induced a little while ago to
praise the principles of those who said, &quot;We are all one man&#x27;s Sons.&quot;{43}{#ge 42:11.} For even if
we are not yet suitable to be called the sons of God, still we may deserve to be called the children
of his eternal image, of his most sacred word; for the image of God is his most ancient word. (148)
And, indeed, in many passages of the law, the children of Israel are called hearers of him that
seeth, since hearing is honoured with the second rank next after the sense of sight, and since that
which is in need of instruction is at all times second to that which can receive clear impressions of
the subjects submitted to it without any such information. (149) And I also admire the things which
are spoken under divine inspiration in the books of Kings, according to which those who flourished
many generations afterwards and lived in a blameless manner, are spoken of as the sons of David
who wrote hymns to God; {44}{2 Ezr. 8:2.} though, during his lifetime, even their great grandfathers had

may not neglect him as a stranger, towards whom he has no bond of goodwill. But that, yielding to a

only in self-defence, and knowing as he did that his own household was superior both in numbers
and in power, would not allow the contest to be protracted till victory declared for his party, in order
that he might not grieve his nephew by the defeat of his men; but standing between the two bodies
of combatants, he, by his pacific speeches, reconciled the contending parties, and that not only for
the moment, but for all future time too; (215) for he knew that if they continued to dwell together,
and to abide in the same place, they would be always differing in opinion and quarrelling with one
another, and continually raising up quarrels and wars with one another. In order that this might not
be the case, he thought it desirable to abandon the custom of dwelling together, and to separate
his habitation from that of his nephew. So, sending for his nephew, he gave him the choice of the
better country, cheerfully agreeing himself to abandon whatever portion the other selected, as he
should thus acquire the greatest of all gains, namely, peace; (216) and yet, what other man would
ever have yielded in any point whatever to one weaker than himself, while he was stronger? and
who that was able to gain the victory would ever have been willing to be defeated, without availing
himself of his power? But this man alone placed the object of his desires, not in strength and
superiority, but in a life free from dissension and blessed with tranquillity, as far as depended on
himself; for which reason he appears the most admirable of all men.

But this translation obscures the lexical range of the Greek and imports later Christian moral theology into a first-century Judean context.
The Greek word μετάνοια does not primarily mean ``feel remorse about moral guilt&#x27;&#x27;; it means ``change of mind&#x27;&#x27; or ``reconsideration,&#x27;&#x27; often used in political or strategic contexts to describe a reversal of stance or allegiance.
Similarly, ἄφεσις fundamentally means ``release&#x27;&#x27; or ``sending away,&#x27;&#x27; and in the Septuagint it is the term for Jubilee-style release of debts, slaves, and land obligations (Hebrew דְּרוֹר deror, שְׁמִטָּה shemittah).

by the misfortune of a man like ourselves. Such an event, therefore, will
be neither pitiful nor terrible. There remains, then, the character between
these two extremes- that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet
whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some
error or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous-
a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such
families.
A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue,
rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not
from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about
as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character
either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. The practice
of the stage bears out our view. At first the poets recounted any legend
that came in their way. Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story
of a few houses- on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager,
Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done  or suffered something
terrible. A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art
should be of this construction. Hence they are in error who censure Euripides
just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end
unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is
that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked
out, are the most tragic in effect; and Euripides, faulty though he may
be in the general management of his subject, yet is felt to be the most
tragic of the poets.
In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first.
Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite
catastrophe for the good and for the bad. It is accounted the best because
of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in w</div>

Lydians precedence in consulting the Oracle and freedom from all payments,
and the right to front seats at the games, with this privilege also for
all time, that any one of them who wished should be allowed to become a
citizen of Delphi.

Oracle the third time; for from the time when he learnt the truth of the
Oracle, he made abundant use of it.

And consulting the Oracle
he inquired whether his monarchy would endure for a long time. And the
Pythian prophetess answered him thus:
&quot;But when it cometh to pass that a mule of the Medes shall be monarch
Then by the pebbly Hermos, O Lydian delicate-footed,
Flee and stay not, and be not ashamed to be callÃ¨d a coward.&quot;
56. By these lines when they came to him Croesus was pleased more than by
all the rest, for he supposed that a mule would never be ruler of the
Medes instead of a man, and accordingly that he himself and his heirs
would never cease from their rule. Then after this he gave thought to
inquire which people of the Hellenes he should esteem the most powerful
and gain over to himself as friends. And inquiring he found that the
Lacedemonians and the Athenians had the pre-eminence, the first of the
Dorian and the others of the Ionian race. For these were the most eminent
races in ancient time, the second being a Pelasgian and the first a
Hellenic race: and the one never migrated from its place in any direction,
while the other was very exceedingly given to wanderings; for in the reign
of Deucalion this race dwelt in Pthiotis, and in the time of Doros the son

Histiaiotis; and when it was driven from Histiaiotis by the sons of

Homer and Plato (Phaedrus 275b) both treat Dodona as a Zeus site where the god&#x27;s will is delivered as speech from the oak.
The dove-Zeus connection extends beyond Dodona: Achaean League coinage from Sikyon pairs a laureate head of Zeus with a dove flying within an olive wreath, directly linking the god and the bird in civic iconography.

PREFACE.
In the spring of 1862 I was induced, at the request of some personal friends,
to print, for private circulation only, a small volume of “Translations
of Poems Ancient and Modern,” in which was included the first Book of the
Iliad. The opinions expressed by some competent judges of the degree of success
which had attended this “attempt to infuse into an almost literal English
version something of the spirit, as well as the simplicity, of the great
original,” [Footnote: Introduction to unpublished volume.] were
sufficiently favourable to encourage me to continue the work which I had begun.
It has afforded me, in the intervals of more urgent business, an unfailing, and
constantly increasing source of interest; and it is not without a feeling of
regret at the completion of my task, and a sincere diffidence as to its
success, that I venture to submit the result of my labour to the ordeal of
public criticism.
Various causes, irrespective of any demerits of the work itself, forbid me to
anticipate for this translation any extensive popularity. First, I fear that
the taste for, and appreciation of, Classical Literature, are greatly on the
decline; next, those who have kept up their classical studies, and are able to
read and enjoy the original, will hardly take an interest in a mere
translation; while the English reader, unacquainted with Greek, will naturally
prefer the harmonious versification and polished brilliancy of Pope’s
translation; with which, as a happy adaptation of the Homeric story to the
spirit of English poetry, I have not the presumption to enter into competition.
But, admirable as it is, Pope’s Iliad can hardly be said to be
Homer’s Iliad; and there may be some who, having lost the familiarity
with the original language which they once possessed, may, if I have at all
succeeded in my attempt, h</div>

The most precise narrative parallel is Siddhartha Gautama’s trial under the Bodhi tree: Māra offers (1) sensual desire, (2) a terrifying challenge demanding miraculous proof of survival, and (3) sovereignty over the world, as related in the Lalitavistara (ch.~24) and the Nidānakathā.
The structural match to the Gospel’s triad of bread-spectacle-kingdoms is striking.
Zarathustra’s confrontation with Angra Mainyu likewise unfolds as a triad: (1) riches and wealth, (2) women and pleasure, and (3) kingship and power; he refuses each in fidelity to asha (truth/order), as preserved in the Vendīdād~19 and the Dēnkard~7.

constructed with such show of foresight can you doubt whether they are

Soc. What shall we say of this passion implanted in man to beget

creature itself, once born, this deep desire of life and fear of death?
Ar. No doubt these do look like the contrivances of some one deliberately
planning the existence of living creatures.
Soc. Well, and doubtless you feel to have a spark of wisdom yourself?
Ar. Put your questions, and I will answer.
Soc. And yet you imagine that elsewhere no spark of wisdom is to be found?
And that, too, when you know that you have in your body a tiny fragment
only of the mighty earth, a little drop of the great waters, and of the
other elements, vast in their extent, you got, I presume, a particle of

spearmen, and through them he saw and buried the herdsman&#x27;s child. This
then had had burial, but him who was afterwards called Cyrus the wife of
the herdsman had received, and was bringing him up, giving him no doubt
some other name, not Cyrus.
114. And when the boy was ten years old, it happened with regard to him as
follows, and this made him known. He was playing in the village in which
were stalls for oxen, he was playing there, I say, with other boys of his
age in the road. And the boys in their play chose as their king this one
who was called the son of the herdsman: and he set some of them to build
palaces and others to be spearmen of his guard, and one of them no doubt
he appointed to be the eye of the king, and to one he gave the office of
bearing the messages,
12401
appointing a work for each one severally.
Now one of these boys who was playing with the rest, the son of Artembares
a man of repute among the Medes, did not do that which Cyrus appointed him
to do; therefore Cyrus bade the other boys seize him hand and foot,
125
and when they obeyed his command he dealt with the boy very roughly,
scourging him. But he, so soon as he was let go, being made much more
angry because he considered that he had been treated with indignity, went
down to the city and complained to his father of the treatment which he
had met with from Cyrus, calling him not Cyrus, for this was not yet his
name, but the son of the herdsman of Astyages. And Artembares in the anger
of the moment went at once to Astyages, taking the boy with him, and he
declared that he had suffered things that were unfitting and said: &quot;O
king, by thy slave, the son of a herdsman, we have been thus outraged,&quot;
showing him the shoulders of his son.
115. And Astyages having heard and seen this, wishing to punish the boy to
avenge the honour of Artembares, sent for both the herdsman and his son.
And when both were present, Astyages lo</div>

There was no hesitation about the verdict for war. Corbulo, familiar for years with his troops and his enemy, was put at the head of operations, lest there should be a fresh blunder from the incompetence of another substitute, seeing that Paetus had inspired complete disgust. The deputation was therefore sent back with its purpose unachieved, but with presents leaving room for hope that Tiridates would not make the same requests in vain, if he brought his suit in person. The administration of Syria was entrusted to Gaius Cestius, the military forces to Corbulo, with the addition of the fifteenth legion from Pannonia under the command of Marius Celsus.⁠

Instructions in writing were given to the tetrarchs⁠

When Paetus returned, with apprehensions of a graver cast, the Caesar contented himself with a jocular reprimand, the wording of which was roughly, that &quot;he was pardoning him on the spot, lest a person with such a tendency to panic might fall ill if his suspense were protracted.&quot;

L. Catilina ought long ago to have been put to death, ought long ago to have suffered the severest penalties of the law ; yes, I was called upon to take such measures by the traditions of the past, by the rigour of the powers committed to me, and by the interests of the state. But how many do you think there were who did not believe my denunciations ? How many who went so far as to defend him ? Yet if I had been convinced that his removal would avert all peril from you, I should long ago have removed L. Catilina at the risk of not only my popularity but even my life.
[4]
But seeing as I did that even you were not yet all of you clear as to the facts, and that if I inflicted on him the death he deserved, I should incur an amount of unpopularity which would hamper me in the task of following up his associates, I let matters take their course, in order that when you saw the enemy plainly, you might be able to deal with him on the open field. Though indeed how gravely formidable I deem this enemy when outside the walls, you may estimate from this fact, that I feel no satisfaction in knowing that he had so few companions in his flight ! Would that he had taken with him the whole of his gang ! Tongilius, whom he began to adore when he was a lad, I am glad to say he has taken, with Publicius and Minucius, whose unpaid tavern scores were not likely to have seriously shaken the constitution : but the men he has left, think of them, and of their debts, and of their importance, and of their high rank !

But of the fourth sect of Jewish philosophy, Judas the Galilean was
the author. These men agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions;
but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is
to be their only Ruler and Lord. They also do not value dying any kinds
of death, nor indeed do they heed the deaths of their relations and friends,
nor can any such fear make them call any man lord. And since this immovable
resolution of theirs is well known to a great many, I shall speak no further
about that matter; nor am I afraid that any thing I have said of them should
be disbelieved, but rather fear, that what I have said is beneath the resolution
they show when they undergo pain. And it was in Gessius Florus&#x27;s time that
the nation began to grow mad with this distemper, who was our procurator,
and who occasioned the Jews to go wild with it by the abuse of his authority,
and to make them revolt from the Romans. And these are the sects of Jewish
philosophy.

1. There are extant five books of

makes mention of these as the only works written by him,  in the following words:
These things are attested by
Papias

Polycarp
, in his fourth book. For five books have been written by him.
These are the words of
Irenæus
.
2. But
Papias
himself in the preface to his discourses by no means declares that he was himself a hearer and eye-
witness
of the
holy
apostles
, but he shows by the words which he uses that he received the doctrines of the
faith
from those who were their friends.
3. He says: But I shall not hesitate also to put down for you along with my interpretations  whatsoever things I have at any time learned carefully from the elders  and carefully remembered, guaranteeing their
truth
. For I did not, like the multitude, take pleasure in those that speak much, but in those that teach the
truth
; not in those that relate strange commandments, but in those that deliver  the commandments given by the
Lord

truth

Alone, Maker of Heaven and Earth.
1. WE have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from
those through whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time
proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to
us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar of our faith.
For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before they possessed &quot;perfect
knowledge,&quot; as some do even venture to say, boasting themselves as improvers of
the apostles. For, after our Lord rose from the dead, [the apostles] were
invested with power from on high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them],
were filled from all [His gifts], and had perfect knowledge: they departed to
the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things [sent] from
God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who indeed do all equally
and individually possess the Gospel of God. Matthew also issued a written Gospel
among the Hebrews
in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying
the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and
interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached
by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel
preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned
upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in
Asia.
2. These have all declared to us that there is one God, Creator of heaven and
earth, announced by the law and the prophets; and one Christ the Son of God. If
any one do not agree to these truths, he despises the companions of the Lord;
nay more, he despises Christ Himself the Lord; yea, he despises the Father also,

They stand in ordered opposition to Rome&#x27;s Beast, just as the Kingdom of God stands in ordered opposition to Babylon.
Revelation stages a clash of empires, not a retreat into abstraction.
By the end of the second century Irenaeus makes this grammar explicit and canonical.

John, to illustrate their conjunctions, shall be proved to be totally in error
by means of this very Gospel, as I have shown in the first book. Since, then,
our opponents do bear testimony to us, and make use of these [documents], our
proof derived from them is firm and true.
8. It is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number
than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live,
and four principal winds,
while the Church is scattered throughout all the world, and the &quot;pillar and
ground&quot;
of the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she
should have four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying
men afresh. From which fact, it is evident that the Word, the Artificer of all,
He that sitteth upon the cherubim, and contains all things, He who was
manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but bound
together by one Spirit. As also David says, when entreating His manifestation,
&quot;Thou that sittest between the cherubim, shine forth.&quot;
For the cherubim, too, were four-faced, and their faces were images of the
dispensation of the Son of God. For, [as the Scripture] says, &quot;The first living
creature was like a lion,&quot;
symbolizing His effectual working, His leadership, and royal power; the second
[living creature] was like a calf, signifying [His] sacrificial and sacerdotal
order; but &quot;the third had, as it were, the face as of a man,&quot;-an evident
description of His advent as a human being; &quot;the fourth was like a flying
eagle,&quot; pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering with His wings over the
Church. And therefore the Gospels are in accord with these things, among which
Christ Jesus is seated. For that according to John relates His original,
effectual, and glorious generation from the Father, thus declaring, &quot;In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the W</div>

For Irenaeus the point is not a cute allegory but a necessity: the Church is spread to the four winds, the world has four zones and four principal winds, and therefore the one Christ must be witnessed in a fourfold way if the proclamation is to match the structure of creation.

From the Fourth Chapter
1.
After this, I beheld, and, lo, a door was opened in heaven.
The new testament is announced as an open door in heaven.
And the first voice which I heard
was
, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up hither.
Since the door is shown to be opened, it is manifest that previously it had been closed to men. And it was sufficiently and fully laid open when Christ ascended with His body to the Father into heaven. Moreover, the first voice which he had heard when he says that it spoke with him, without contradiction condemns those who say that one spoke in the
prophets
, another in the
Gospel
; since it is rather He Himself who comes, that is the same who spoke in the
prophets
. For John was of the
circumcision
, and all that people which had heard the announcement of the
Old Testament
was edified with his word.
That very same voice,
said he,
that I had heard, that said to me, Come up hither.
That is the
Spirit
, whom a little before he confesses that he had seen walking as the
Son of man
in the midst of the golden candlesticks. And he now gathers from Him what had been foretold in similitudes by the law, and associates with this scripture all the former
prophets
, and opens up the
Scriptures
. And because our Lord invited in His own name all
believers
into heaven, He immediately poured out the
Holy Spirit
, who should bring them to heaven. He says:—

Immediately I was in the
Spirit

subject, but rather from our affection for the Deity we ought to endeavour to exert ourselves even

II. (7) For some men, admiring the world itself rather than the Creator of the world, have
represented it as existing without any maker, and eternal; and as impiously as falsely have
represented God as existing in a state of complete inactivity, while it would have been right on the
other hand to marvel at the might of God as the creator and father of all, and to admire the world in
a degree not exceeding the bounds of moderation. (8) But Moses, who had early reached the very
summits of philosophy, {1}{this is in accordance with the description of him in the Bible, where he is represented as
being learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.} and who had learnt from the oracles of God the most
numerous and important of the principles of nature, was well aware that it is indispensable that in all
existing things there must be an active cause, and a passive subject; and that the active cause is

Vice). This leads Philo
on to the elaborate allegory (20-44) of the two, as courtesan and chaste woman,
pressing their claims upon the mind. Virtue&#x27;s harangue, beginning 28, which
contains what is probably the most formidable catalogue of bad qualities ever
drawn up (32), includes an impassioned eulogy of toil (35-41) and ends with
some loosely connected thoughts (43-44) on the inferior value of the secular
learning. Her pleading prevails with the mind (45), which becomes what Abel
wasa shepherd, and thus we resume the real consideration of the text. The
true shepherd controls the unreasoning, but not vicious, faculties (46) and
the greatness of the calling is illustrated from various verses in the Pentateuch
(48-51). We should here expect some similar interpretation of Cain&#x27;s occupation,
but Philo dismisses this with the remark that he has treated it in an earlier
book (51).
III. The charges brought against Cain in v. 3 are (a) that he offered only
&quot;after some days,&quot; (b) that he offered of the fruits, but not of
the first-fruits. The first naturally leads to a homily (53) on the duty of
ready service. The causes of tardiness are discussed and rebuked by appropriate
texts (54-57), and an example of ready thankfulness is found (59) in the story
of Abraham, when he bids Sarah
hasten
to prepare a meal for the angelic
visitors of Gen. xviii. Two side thoughts are suggested by this story, (1)
an interpretation of the three measures of meal (59), (2) of the phrase &quot;buried
cakes&quot; (
i.e.
, cakes haked in the ashes (60) which Philo explains
as the duty of reticence about sacred truths; and as this phrase is also used
of the dough brought out of Egypt, we are led on to some thoughts about the
symbolism of the passover (60-63). We return (64) to the duty of avoiding
delay, and Philo dwells on the timelessness of God&#x27;s actions, which we should
imitate in our worship (64-68). This is contrasted (69) with Pharaoh&#x27;s postponement

(207) His positive assertion, therefore, is one which may be thoroughly trusted in the first place,

admiring the exceeding excellency of the great uncreated God, says, &quot;And thou shalt swear by his

confirmation and testimony from the word of God. But God is his own confirmation and most
unerring testimony.

we do not spare even that beloved child of virtue, prosperity, surrendering it to the Creator, and
thinking it right that our offspring should become the possession of God, but not of any created
being. And that expression, also, is </div>

John writes in the intellectual Greek of Alexandria, the greatest philosophical center of the eastern Mediterranean.
His opening word Logos uses the exact metaphysical sense found in Philo of Alexandria&#x27;s treatises such as De Opificio Mundi , where the Logos is the divine rational structure ordering the cosmos.
The term monogenēs in John 1:14 and 1:18 mirrors Philo&#x27;s use in for the unique heavenly image, showing that the author shared Alexandrian philosophical vocabulary rather than Palestinian synagogue Greek.

Egyptian hymns describe Amun as the hidden source whose name and essence are unseen and unknowable.
John states that God is unseen and inaccessible in essence in John 1:18, John 5:37, and John 6:46.
These verses deny direct vision, voice, or form of God without qualification.
Egyptian theology defines Ra as the visible manifestation who gives life and light to all, as expressed in the Book of the Dead (Hymn to Ra).
John assigns this role to the Son as light and life in John 1:4--9, John 8:12, and John 12:46.
The Father remains unseen while the Son is visible and life-giving, preserving strict separation between source and manifestation.
John introduces the Logos as the mediating principle between God and the world in John 1:1--14.

Egyptian creation theology already describes creation by word, where Ptah brings all things into being through the heart&#x27;s thought (Sia) and the tongue&#x27;s command (Hu), as stated in the Memphite Theology on the Shabaka Stone .
This doctrine declares that all things were completed through what the heart conceived and the tongue spoke, which predates Greek philosophy by many centuries.

CONTAINING THE INTERVAL OF TWENTY-TWO YEARS.
FROM FADUS THE PROCURATOR TO FLORUS.
1
UPON the death of king Agrippa, which we have related in the foregoing
book, Claudius Caesar sent Cassius Longinus as successor to Marcus, out
of regard to the memory of king Agrippa, who had often desired of him by
letters, while be was alive, that he would not suffer Marcus to be any
longer president of Syria. But Fadus, as soon as he was come procurator
into Judea, found quarrelsome doings between the Jews that dwelt in Perea,
and the people of Philadelphia, about their borders, at a village called
Mia, that was filled with men of a warlike temper; for the Jews of Perea
had taken up arms without the consent of their principal men, and had destroyed
many of the Philadelphians. When Fadus was informed of this procedure,
it provoked him very much that they had not left the determination of the
matter to him, if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any
wrong, but had rashly taken up arms against them. So he seized upon three
of their principal men, who were also the causes of this sedition, and
ordered them to be bound, and afterwards had one of them slain, whose name
was Hannibal; and he banished the other two, Areram and Eleazar. Tholomy
also, the arch robber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and
slain, but not till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians.
And indeed, from that time, Judea was cleared of robberies by the care
and providence of Fadus. He also at this time sent for the high priests
and the principal citizens of Jerusalem, and this at the command of the
emperor, and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment and
the sacred vestment, which it is customary for nobody but the high priest
to wear, in the tower of Antonia, that it might be under the power of the
Romans, as it had been formerly. Now the Jews durst not contradict what
he had said, but desired Fadus, however, and Longinus, (which la</div>

Acts organizes major turning points around long public speeches that interpret events, following Greek historian practice rather than courtroom debate (Acts 2; Acts 17).

Let us, however, resume our discussion from the point at which
we digressed. To judge from the lives that men lead, most men, and men
of the most vulgar type, seem (not without some ground) to identify the
good, or happiness, with pleasure; which is the reason why they love the
life of enjoyment. For there are, we may say, three prominent types of
life- that just mentioned, the political, and thirdly the contemplative
life. Now the mass of mankind are evidently quite slavish in their tastes,
preferring a life suitable to beasts, but they get some ground for their
view from the fact that many of those in high places share the tastes of
Sardanapallus. A consideration of the prominent types of life shows that
people of superior refinement and of active disposition identify happiness
with honour; for this is, roughly speaking, the end of the political life.
But it seems too superficial to be what we are looking for, since it is
thought to depend on those who bestow honour rather than on him who receives
it, but the good we divine to be something proper to a man and not easily
taken from him. Further, men seem to pursue honour in order that they may
be assured of their goodness; at least it is by men of practical wisdom
that they seek to be honoured, and among those who know them, and on the
ground of their virtue; clearly, then, according to them, at any rate,
virtue is better. And perhaps one might even suppose this to be, rather
than honour, the end of the political life. But even this appears somewhat
incomplete; for possession of virtue seems actually compatible with being
asleep, or with lifelong inactivity, and, further, with the greatest sufferings
and misfortunes; but a man who was living so no one would call happy, unless
he were maintaining a thesis at all costs. B</div>

The phoenix does not fly to Rome, or to the Capitoline, or to any imperial altar in Italy.

73. Now for the following reasons Croesus was marching into Cappadokia:—first
because he desired to acquire the land in addition to his own possessions,
and then especially because he had confidence in the oracle and wished to
take vengeance on Cyrus for Astyages. For Cyrus the son of Cambyses had
conquered Astyages and was keeping him in captivity, who was brother by
marriage to Croesus and king of the Medes: and he had become the brother
by marriage of Croesus in this manner:—A horde of the nomad
Scythians at feud with the rest withdrew and sought refuge in the land of
the Medes: and at this time the ruler of the Medes was Kyaxares the son of
Phraortes, the son of DeÃ¯okes, who at first dealt well with these
Scythians, being suppliants for his protection; and esteeming them very
highly he delivered boys to them to learn their speech and the art of
shooting with the bow. Then time went by, and the Scythians used to go out
continually to the chase and always brought back something; till once it
happened that they took nothing, and when they returned with empty hands
Kyaxares (being, as he showed on this occasion, not of an eminently good
disposition

towards them. And they, when they had received this treatment from
Kyaxares, considering that they had suffered indignity, planned to kill

to bear it to Kyaxares and give it to him, pretending that it was game

Classical writers already describe the phoenix in imperial colors.

CHAP. 2. (2.)—THE PHŒNIX.
Æthiopia and India, more especially, produce
9
birds of diversified plumage, and such as quite surpass all description. In
the front rank of these is the phœnix,
10
that famous bird of
Arabia; though I am not quite sure that its existence is not
all a fable. It is said that there is only one in existence in the
whole world, and that that one has not been seen very often.
We are told that this bird is of the size of an eagle,
11
and
has a brilliant golden plumage around the neck, while the rest
of the body is of a purple colour; except the tail, which is
azure, with long feathers intermingled of a roseate hue; the
throat is adorned with a crest, and the head with a tuft of
feathers. The first Roman who described this bird, and who
has done so with the greatest exactness, was the senator Manilius, so famous for his learning; which he owed, too, to the
instructions of no teacher. He tells us that no person has
ever seen this bird eat, that in Arabia it is looked upon as
sacred to the sun, that it lives five hundred and forty years,
12
that when it becomes old it builds a nest of cassia and sprigs
of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays its body
down upon them to die; that from its bones and marrow there
springs at first a sort of small worm, which in time changes
into a little bird: that the first thing that it does is to perform
the obsequies of its predecessor, and to carry the nest entire
to the city of the Sun near Panchaia,
13
and there deposit it
upon the altar of that divinity.
The same Manilius states also, that the revolution of the

The phoenix, purple with royal plumage, and the martyr, clothed in the purple of blood, are drawn into the same semantic field of suffering, sovereignty, and cosmic renewal.

Chapter 13. From Our Author&#x27;s View of a Verse in the Ninety-Second Psalm, the Phœnix is Made a Symbol of the Resurrection of Our Bodies.
If, however, all nature but faintly figures our resurrection; if creation affords no sign precisely like it, inasmuch as its several phenomena can hardly be said to die so much as to come to an end, nor again be deemed to be reanimated, but only re-formed; then take a most complete and unassailable
symbol
of our
hope
, for it shall be an animated being, and subject alike to life and death. I refer to the bird which is peculiar to the East, famous for its singularity, marvelous from its posthumous life, which renews its life in a
voluntary
death; its dying day is its birthday, for on it it departs and returns; once more a phœnix where just now there was none; once more himself, but just now out of
existence
; another, yet the same. What can be more express and more significant for our subject; or to what other thing can such a phenomenon bear

Scripture
says:
The righteous
shall flourish like the phœnix;
that is, shall flourish or revive, from death, from the grave — to teach you to
believe
that a bodily substance may be recovered even from the fire. Our Lord has declared that we are
better than many sparrows:

well, if not better than many a phœnix too, it were no great thing. But must men die once for all, while birds in Arabia are sure of a resurrection?

NOW the necessity which Archelaus was under of taking a journey to
Rome was the occasion of new disturbances; for when he had mourned for
his father seven days,

and had given a very expensive funeral feast to the multitude, (which custom
is the occasion of poverty to many of the Jews, because they are forced
to feast the multitude; for if any one omits it, he is not esteemed a holy
person,) he put on a white garment, and went up to the temple, where the
people accosted him with various acclamations. He also spake kindly to
the multitude from an elevated seat and a throne of gold, and returned
them thanks for the zeal they had shown about his father&#x27;s funeral, and
the submission they had made to him, as if he were already settled in the
kingdom; but he told them withal, that he would not at present take upon
him either the authority of a king, or the names thereto belonging, until
Caesar, who is made lord of this whole affair by the testament, confirm
the succession; for that when the soldiers would have set the diadem on
his head at Jericho, he would not accept of it; but that he would make
abundant requitals, not to the soldiers only, but to the people, for their
alacrity and good-will to him, when the superior lords [the Romans] should
have given him a complete title to the kingdom; for that it should be his
study to appear in all things better than his father.

Upon this the multitude were pleased, and presently made a trial
of what he intended, by asking great things of him; for some made a clamor
that he would ease them in their taxes; others, that he would take off
the duties upon commodities; and some, that he would loose those that were
in prison; in all which cases he answered readily to their satisfaction,
in order to get the good-will of the multitude; after which he offered

For as the Jewish nation is widely dispersed over all the habitable
earth among its inhabitants, so it is very much intermingled with Syria
by reason of its neighborhood, and had the greatest multitudes in Antioch
by reason of the largeness of the city, wherein the kings, after Antiochus,
had afforded them a habitation with the most undisturbed tranquillity;
for though Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, laid Jerusalem waste, and
spoiled the temple, yet did those that succeeded him in the kingdom restore
all the donations that were made of brass to the Jews of Antioch, and dedicated
them to their synagogue, and granted them the enjoyment of equal privileges
of citizens with the Greeks themselves; and as the succeeding kings treated
them after the same manner, they both multiplied to a great number, and
adorned their temple gloriously by fine ornaments, and with great magnificence,
in the use of what had been given them. They also made proselytes of a
great many of the Greeks perpetually, and thereby after a sort brought
them to be a portion of their own body. But about this time when the present
war began, and Vespasian was newly sailed to Syria, and all men had taken
up a great hatred against the Jews, then it was that a certain person,
whose name was Antiochus, being one of the Jewish nation, and greatly respected
on account of his father, who was governor of the Jews at Antioch

came upon the theater at a time when the people of Antioch were assembled

Â While the time, the place, and â what is in such case the most difficult thing â the person to speak the first word were being discussed, while hope and fear, plans and possibilities filled every mind, as Vespasian stepped from his quarters, aÂ few soldiers who were drawn up in their usual order to salute him as their Legate, saluted him as Emperor. Then the rest ran up and began to call him Caesar and Augustus; they heaped on him all the titles of an emperor. Their minds suddenly turned from fears to confidence in Fortune&#x27;s favour. In Vespasian himself there was no arrogance or pride, no novelty of conduct in his new estate. The moment that he had dispelled the mist which his elevation to such a height spread before his eyes, he spoke as befitted a soldier; then he began to receive favourable reports from every quarter; for Mucianus, who was waiting only for this action, now administered to his own eager troops the oath of allegiance to Vespasian. Then he entered the theatre at Antioch, where the people regularly hold their public assemblies, and addressed the crowd which hurried there, and expressed itself in extravagant adulation. His speech was graceful enough although he spoke in Greek, for he knew how to give a certain air to all he said and did. There was nothing that angered the province and the army so much as the assertion of Mucianus that Vitellius had decided to transfer the legions of Germany to Syria, where they could enjoy a profitable and easy service, while in exchange he would assign to the troops in Syria the wintry climate and the laborious duties of Germany. For the provincials were accustomed to live with the soldiers, and enjoyed association with them; in fact,

The late 60s and early 70s AD were a time of massive instability across the Greek East of the Roman Empire.
In Galilee, Josephus fought the Romans as commander of the northern army in the First Jewish--Roman War (66--73 AD).
At the same time, a fierce Greek--Jewish civil war broke out in Alexandria in 66 AD, when the Greek and Jewish quarters of the city erupted into mutual slaughter; the legions sent by Vespasian to restore order eventually razed much of the city .
Similar inter-ethnic riots followed in Antioch and Damascus, where Greek and Jewish citizens massacred each other in the thousands .

sixty-nine

Â For they did not succeed one another legitimately, but each of them, even while his rival was alive and still ruling, believed himself to be emperor from the moment that he even got a glimpse of the throne.

Â Titus after becoming ruler committed no act of murder or of amatory passion, but showed himself upright, though plotted against, and
self-controlled

Â In the former case, they are heedless of the good name of the sovereignty and in their greed misuse the authority it gives them, thus doing many things that make their power the object of envy and slander; but actual monarchs, knowing that everything depends upon them, have an eye to good repute also.

Babylon
), as we have said above, to have reigned twenty-six years, although I do not find that recorded in the sacred history. But it has perhaps happened that, while I was engaged in searching out many points, I found this remark in the work of some anonymous author which had become interpolated in course of
time
, and in which the dates of the Babylonish kings were contained. I did not think it right to pass the remark unnoticed, since it does in fact harmonize with the Chronicles, and thus its account agrees with us, to the effect that, through the succession of the kings, whose dates the record contained, it completed seventy years up to the first year of king Cyrus, and such in fact is the number of years which is stated in the sacred history to have elapsed from the captivity up to the time of Cyrus.
Chapter 6.
After
Nebuchadnezzar
, the kingdom fell to his son, whom I find called Euilmarodac in the Chronicles. He died in the twelfth year of his reign, and made room for his younger brother, who was called Balthasar. He, when in the fourteenth year he gave a public feast to his chief men and rulers, ordered the
sacred vessels
(which had been taken away by
Nebuchadnezzar
from the temple at Jerusalem, yet had not been employed for any uses of the king, but were kept laid up in the treasury) to be brought forth. And when all
persons
, both of the male and female sex, with his wives and concubines, were using these amid the luxury and licentiousness of a royal banquet, suddenly the king observed fingers writing upon the wall, and the letters were perceived to be formed into words.  But no one could be found who was able to read the writing. The king, therefore, in perturbation called for the

Josephus, Paul, Peter, and James were not opponents on a fragmented religious landscape.
They operated inside the same political world: an imperial-restoration movement that drew Greek, Jewish, and eastern elites into a single anti-Roman horizon.
They did not share the same rituals or schools, but they served the same cause in different registers.
Their different ``religions&#x27;&#x27; were branches of the same royal cause, adapted to different audiences.
Josephus, in his Testimonium Flavianum , describes Jesus as a leader who attracted many followers.
In the royal reading this statement is not paradoxical at all.
Josephus remained faithful to the religion of Moses, but he also recognized Jesus as a Christos---a royal leader of Galilee---whose movement, though d</div>

and were caught by men prepared for what they were about, there were a
great number of them slain by this means, and others of them ran away wounded.
And thus an end was put to this sedition.

Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful
to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such
men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of
the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate,
at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to
the cross,
those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared
to them alive again the third day;
as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful
things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him,
are not extinct at this day.

About the same time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder,
and certain shameful practices happened about the temple of Isis that was
at Rome. I will now first take notice of the wicked attempt about the temple
of Isis, and will then give an account of the Jewish affairs. There was
at Rome a woman whose name was Paulina; one who, on account of the dignity
of her ancestors, and by the regular conduct of a virtuous life, had a
great reputation: she was also very rich; and although she was of a beautiful
countenance, and in that flower of her age wherein women are the most gay,
yet did she lead a life of great modesty. She was married to Saturninus,
one that was every way answerable to her in an excellent character. Decius
Mundus fell in love with this woman, who was a man very high in the equestrian
order; and as she was of too great dignity to be caught by presents, and
had already rejected them, though they had been sent in great abundance,
he was still more inflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promised
to give her two hu</div>

Origen envisions a time when ``the Word has prevailed over the entire rational creation&#x27;&#x27;---the oikoumene, the civilized world.
The ``kingdom&#x27;&#x27; that Christ will ``deliver up to God the Father&#x27;&#x27; is a political reality: the universal kingdom unified under divine rule.
Origen&#x27;s concept of apokatastasis (ἀποκατάστασις)---the restoration of all things---is often spiritualized by modern interpreters, but his language is explicitly political.
He describes the eventual submission of all archontes (ἄρχοντες, rulers) and exousiai (ἐξουσίαι, authorities) to Christ , using the vocabulary of imperial administration.
This is restoration theology: the reconstitution of a divinely ordered political cosmos, centered in the Greek-speaking East where Origen wrote.

The result of our reasoning, therefore, is to show that those things which happen to us from without are not in our own power; but that to make a good or bad use of those things which do so happen, by help of that reason which is within us, and which distinguishes and determines how these things ought to be used,
is
within our power.
6. And now, to confirm the deductions of reason by the authority of Scripture — viz., that it is our own doing whether we live rightly or not, and that we are not compelled, either by those causes which come to us from without, or, as some think, by the presence of
fate
— we adduce the testimony of the
prophet
Micah, in these words:
If it has been announced to you, O man, what is
good
, or what the Lord requires of you, except that you should do
justice
, and
love
mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord your God.
Moses
also speaks as follows:
I have placed before your face the way of life and the way of death: choose what is
good
, and walk in it.
Isaiah, moreover, makes this declaration:
If you are willing, and hear me, you shall eat the good of the land. But if you be unwilling, and will not hear me, the sword shall consume you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.
In the Psalm, too, it is written:
If My people had heard Me, if
Israel
had walked in My ways, I would have humbled her enemies to nothing;
by which he shows that it was in the power of the people to hear, and to walk in the ways of
God
. The Saviour also saying,
I say unto you, Resist not
evil
;
and,
Whoever shall be
angry
with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment;
and,
Whosoever shall look upon a
woman
to
lust
after her, has already committed
adultery</div>

Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons (a Greek-speaking city in Gaul), articulates a millennialist eschatology in that envisions a literal earthly kingdom ruled by Christ.
Writing around 180 AD, Irenaeus interprets Daniel&#x27;s vision of four kingdoms (Dan 2:31-45) as prophecy of the succession of empires---Babylonian, Median, Persian, and finally the Roman Empire---with the kingdom of God as the fifth and final kingdom that will crush and replace all earthly powers.
In , Irenaeus writes:
In the end, the stone cut without hands [from Daniel] shall smite the image upon the iron and clay feet and shall break them to pieces, and shall itself fill the whole earth.
This refers to the kingdom of our Lord...which</div>

Chapter 15. The Error of Seneca in Philosophy, and How the Speech of Philosophers is at Variance with Their Life.
Under the influence of the same
error
(for who could keep the right course when Cicero is in
error
?), Seneca said:
Philosophy is nothing else than the right method of living, or the science of living honourably, or the art of passing a good life. We shall not
err
in saying that
philosophy
is the law of living well and honourably. And he who spoke of it as a rule of life, gave to it that which was its due.
He evidently did not refer to the common name of
philosophy
; for, since this is diffused into many
sects
and systems, and has nothing certain — nothing, in short, respecting which all agree with one mind and one voice — what can be so false as that
philosophy
should be called the rule of life, since the diversity of its precepts hinders the right way and causes confusion? Or the law of living well, when its subjects are widely discordant? Or the science of passing life, in which nothing else is effected by its repeated contradictions than general  uncertainty? For I ask whether he thinks that the Academy is
philosophy
or not? I do not think that he will deny it. And if this is so, none of these things, therefore, is in agreement with
philosophy
; which renders all things uncertain, abrogates law, esteems art as nothing, subverts method, distorts rule, entirely takes away
knowledge
. Therefore all those things are false, because they are inconsistent with a system which is always uncertain, and up to this time explaining nothing. Therefore no system, or science, or law of living well, has been established, except in this the only
true
and heavenly wisdom, which had been unknown to
philosophers
. For that earthly wisdom, since it is false, becomes varied and manifold, and altogether opposed to itself. And as there i</div>

2. The man, however, who would undertake their conversion, must possess an
accurate knowledge of their systems or schemes of doctrine. For it is impossible
for any one to heal the sick, if he has no knowledge of the disease of the
patients. This was the reason that my predecessors-much superior men to myself,
too-were unable, notwithstanding, to refute the Valentinians satisfactorily,
because they were ignorant of these men&#x27;s system;
which I have with all care delivered to thee in the first book in which I have
also shown that their doctrine is a recapitulation of all the heretics. For
which reason also, in the second, we have had, as in a mirror, a sight of their
entire discomfiture. For they who oppose these men (the Valentinians) by the
right method, do [thereby] oppose all who are of an evil mind; and they who
overthrow them, do in fact overthrow every kind of heresy.
3. For their system is blasphemous above all [others], since they represent
that the Maker and Framer, who is one God, as I have shown, was produced from a
defect or apostasy. They utter blasphemy, also, against our Lord, by cutting off
and dividing Jesus from Christ, and Christ from the Saviour, and again the
Saviour from the Word, and the Word from the Only-begotten. And since they
allege that the Creator originated from a defect or apostasy, so have they also
taught that Christ and the Holy Spirit were emitted on account of this defect,
and that the Saviour was a product of those Aeons who were produced from a
defect; so that there is nothing but blasphemy to be found among them. In the

It is established, then, that He has come for whom it has been reserved, and in whom is the expectation of the
Gentiles
. And this manifestly seems to be fulfilled in the multitude of those who have
believed
on God through Christ out of the different nations.
4. In the song of Deuteronomy,  also, it is pro­phetically declared that, on account of the
sins
of the former people, there was to be an election of a fool­ish nation — no other, certainly, than that which was brought about by Christ; for thus the words run:
They have moved Me to
anger
with their images, and I will stir them up to jealousy; I will arouse them to
anger
against a foolish nation.
We may therefore evidently see how the Hebrews, who are said to have excited God&#x27;s
anger
by means of those (
idols
), which are no gods, and to have aroused His
wrath
by their images, were themselves also excited to jealousy by means of a foolish nation, which
God
has chosen by the advent of
Jesus Christ
and His
disciples
. For the following is the language of the apostle:
For you see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men among you after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble (are called): but God has chosen the foolish things of the world, and the things which are not, to destroy the things which formerly
existed

Israel

No flesh, I say, should
glory

God

Chapter 1. Order of Contents
It will follow, I think, that I should treat of
martyrdom
, and of who the perfect man is. With these points shall be included what follows in accordance with the demands of the points to be spoken about, and how both bond and free must equally philosophize, whether male or female in sex. And in the sequel, after finishing what is to be said on
faith
and inquiry, we shall set forth the department of
symbols
; so that, on cursorily concluding the discourse on ethics, we shall exhibit the advantage which has accrued to the Greeks from the barbarian
philosophy
. After which sketch, the brief explanation of the
Scriptures
both against the Greeks and against the
Jews
will be presented, and whatever points we were unable to embrace in the previous
Miscellanies
(through having respect necessarily to the multitude of matters), in accordance with the commencement of the poem, purposing to finish them in one commentary. In addition to these points, afterwards on completing the sketch, as far as we can in accordance with what we propose, we must give an account of the physical doctrines of the Greeks and of the barbarians, respecting elementary principles, as far as their opinions have reached us, and argue against the principal views excogitated by the
philosophers
.
It will naturally fall after these, after a cursory view of theology, to discuss the opinions handed down respecting
prophecy
; so that, having demonstrated that the
Scriptures
which we
believe
are valid from their
omnipotent
authority, we shall be able to go over them consecutively, and to show thence to all the
heresies

            <div class="text-box">Modern scholarship treats Hermas as a bland moral allegory about repentance and church discipline, hardly the stuff of mass appeal.
But the political reading reveals why it resonated so powerfully with Greek-speaking audiences under Roman occupation: Hermas is an extended allegory of imperial restoration, encoding Greek nostalgia for lost sovereignty in the imagery of an aging woman transformed back into youth, a ruined tower rebuilt to former glory, and a people purified and restored to their rightful place.
The Vision of the Old Woman Transformed: Restoration of Greek Vigor
The central vision of Hermas features an old woman who progressively becomes younger.
In the first vision, she appears elderly, seated in a chair, holding a book.

Fourth Vision
CONCERNING THE TRIAL AND TRIBULATION THAT ARE TO COME UPON MEN.
CHAPTER I.
Twenty days after the former vision I saw another vision,
brethren --a representation of the tribulation that is to
come. I was going to a country house along the Campanian road. Now
the house lay about ten furlongs from the public road. The district
is one rarely traversed. And as I walked alone, I prayed the
Lord to complete the revelations which He had made to me through His
holy Church, that He might strengthen me, and give repentance
to all His servants who were going astray, that His great and
glorious name might be glorified because He vouchsafed to show me
His marvels. And while I was glorifying Him and giving Him
thanks, a voice, as it were, answered me, &quot;Doubt not, Hermas;&quot; and I
began to think with myself, and to say, &quot;What reason have I to
doubt--I who have been established by the Lord, and who have seen
such glorious sights?&quot; I advanced a little, brethren, and, lo! I see
dust rising even to the heavens. I began to say to myself, &quot;Are
cattle approaching and raising the dust?&quot; It was about a furlong&#x27;s
distance from me. And, 18
lo! I see the dust rising more and more, so that I imagined that
it was something sent from God. But the sun now shone out a little,
and, lo! I see a mighty beast like a whale, and out of its mouth
fiery locusts proceeded. But the size of that beast was about a
hundred feet, and it had a head like an urn. I began to weep,
and to call on the Lord to rescue me from it. Then I remembered the
word which I had heard, &quot;Doubt not, O Hermas.&quot; Clothed, therefore,
my brethren, with faith in the Lord? and remembering the great
things which He had taught me, I boldly faced the beast. Now that
beast came on with such noise and force, that it could itself have
destroyed a city. I came near it, and the monstrous beast
stretched itself out on the ground, and showed nothin</div>

The Tower Vision: Rebuilding the Greek Oikoumene
The most sustained allegory in Hermas is the vision of the tower being built.
The tower is constructed of stones, some of which are rejected, some of which require shaping and purification before they can be fitted into the structure.
The tower represents ``the Church,&#x27;&#x27; but the architectural imagery is unmistakably Greek: the tower (pyrgos, πύργος) built of caref</div>

Third Vision
CONCERNING THE BUILDING OF THE TRIUMPHANT CHURCH, AND THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF REPROBATE MEN.
CHAPTER I.
The vision which I saw, my brethren, was of the following
nature. Having fasted frequently, and having prayed to the Lord that
He would show me the revelation which He promised to show me through
that old woman, the same night that old woman appeared to me, and
said to me, &quot;Since you are so anxious and eager to know all things,
go into the part of the country where you tarry; and about the fifth
hour I shall appear unto you, and show you all that you ought
to see.&quot; I asked her, saying &quot;Lady, into what part of the country am
I to go?&quot; And she said, &quot;Into any part you wish.&quot; Then I chose a
spot which was suitable, and retired. Before, however, I began to
speak and to mention the place, she said to me, &quot;I will come where
you wish.&quot; Accordingly, I went to the country, and counted the
hours, and reached the place where I, had promised to meet her. And
I see an ivory seat ready placed, and on it a linen cushion, and
above the linen cushion was spread a covering of fine linen.
Seeing these laid out, and yet no one in the place, I began to feel
awe, and as it were a trembling seized hold of me, and my hair stood
on end, and as it were a horror came upon me when I saw that I was
all alone. But on coming back to myself and calling to mind the
glory of God, I took courage, bent my knees, and again confessed my
sins to God as I had done before. Whereupon the old woman
approached, accompanied by six young men whom I had also seen
before; and she stood behind me, and listened to me, as I prayed and
confessed my sins to the Lord. And touching me she said, &quot;Hermas,

During confession of sins in ancient Egypt, the following was said in the Hymn to Amun (Papyrus Leiden I 350) : quote You are Amun, the Lord of the silent, who comes at the voice of the poor; when I call to you in my distress You come and rescue me.<br><small style="color:#6b7280">chapter3.tex:501</small></div></div>

            <div class="eval-box">CONFIRMED. Jan Assmann&#x27;s &#x27;The Search for God in Ancient Egypt&#x27; (2001) extensively discusses Egyptian personal piety theology, including the Amun cult at Thebes. Papyrus Leiden I 350 is a genuine Egyptian text (the &#x27;Leiden Hymn to Amun&#x27;), and it does contain language about Amun as a compassionate deity who hears prayers of the poor and comes to rescue the distressed. The specific passage quoted in the manuscript (&#x27;You are Amun, the Lord of the silent, who comes at the voice of the poor&#x27;) is from this hymn. Assmann discusses the development of personal piety religion and the theology of a hidden, compassionate god. The manuscript cites Assmann in the context of Amun as a forgiving deity, which aligns with the themes of personal piety and divine mercy that Assmann analyzes. The Papyrus Leiden I 350 reference is accurate.</div>

Attridge does explore the relationship between Johannine and Philonic Logos concepts. The phrase &#x27;two riffs on one Logos&#x27; is attributed to Attridge as a memorable characterization, and the description of his position — that John and Philo share the same conceptual framework, with incarnation being John&#x27;s unique contribution — is consistent with his published views on the Johannine Prologue&#x27;s engagement with Hellenistic Judaism.

Yet this very point confirms Philo&#x27;s significance, since his writings show that such a &quot;high Christology&quot; was already part of Alexandrian Judaism.

            <div class="text-box"><div style="margin-bottom:6px">The physical papyri, the philosophical language, and the conceptual framework all point to an Alexandrian environment where Greek metaphysics and Jewish scripture had been fused for centuries. John fits Egypt because no other region of the Eastern Mediterranean used Jewish Greek with such technical philosophical precision. The deepest continuity between the religious world of Ptolemaic Egypt and the ritual life of Christianity is the shared liturgical grammar in which the divine presence is contained, carried, displayed, and received, and John&#x27;s ``living bread&#x27;&#x27; discourse is most naturally read against a culture already shaped by centuries of divine processions, sacred offerings, and solar theophanies. Egyptian temple religion centered on the god housed in a portable tabernacle, carried on the shoulders of priests, surrounded by a solar halo or radiating frame, revealed before an altar in a moment that made the presence of the deity visible, offered bread, wine, incense, and light, and then returned to the sanctuary once the encounter between god and people had been accomplished, as depicted in the Opet Festival reliefs at Luxor Temple . This ritual sequence---procession, elevation, revelation, adoration, recession---survives as a pattern continuity in the Christian Mass, where the consecrated host is preserved in a tabernacle, brought in solemn procession to the altar, elevated in silence, displayed to the people as the visible point of divine presence, incensed and adored, and finally reposed, completing a cycle that would not have felt alien in Ptolemaic Alexandria. The same ritual grammar survives with particular clarity in Eucharistic Adoration and Benediction, where the consecrated Host is elevated, made visibly radiant in the monstrance, adored, and then formally reposed.<br><small style="color:#6b7280">chapter5.tex:928</small></div></div>

The Opet Festival involved a ritual procession of the cult statues of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu from Karnak to Luxor Temple in portable barque shrines (tabernacles), carried on the shoulders of priests. The reliefs show offering, elevation, and adoration scenes. The manuscript describes a ritual sequence of &#x27;procession, elevation, revelation, adoration, recession&#x27; which is a reasonable characterization of the Opet Festival ritual as depicted in the reliefs. The publication is freely available as a PDF from the Oriental Institute.</div>

Diaspora synagogues themselves functioned with civic-administrative features---officers, treasurers, communal courts---making them compatible with the civic ekklesia frame. Recognizing hybridity avoids reductionism: the continuity argument concerns administrative and sociological structures, not theological content. But for the Greek-speaking cities Paul addresses, the ekklesia term and the observed behaviors map most strongly onto civic practice, supported by scholars such as Young-Ho Park, Philip Esler, and George van Kooten, who have independently argued that early Christian assemblies must be understood in the context of continuing political institutions rather than as purely novel religious formations . Papyrological evidence confirms that these assemblies were visible to Roman administration as corporate bodies.<br><small style="color:#6b7280">chapter5.tex:304</small></div></div>

The manuscript&#x27;s characterization that Esler argued &#x27;early Christian assemblies must be understood in the context of continuing political institutions&#x27; is consistent with his social-scientific approach, which treats the ekklesia as a real social institution rather than a purely spiritual concept.</div>

The same circular reasoning governs the conventional dating of Papias of Hierapolis, who is commonly placed c.~120 despite the absence of any explicit ancient date.

Recognizing hybridity avoids reductionism: the continuity argument concerns administrative and sociological structures, not theological content. But for the Greek-speaking cities Paul addresses, the ekklesia term and the observed behaviors map most strongly onto civic practice, supported by scholars such as Young-Ho Park, Philip Esler, and George van Kooten, who have independently argued that early Christian assemblies must be understood in the context of continuing political institutions rather than as purely novel religious formations .

Stark models Christianity&#x27;s expansion as network-based diffusion through existing social ties in urban centers, estimating a growth rate of ~40% per decade. The manuscript cites Stark under &#x27;Missionary Diffusion Model&#x27; alongside Harnack, which accurately captures Stark&#x27;s contribution.</div>

Barbara Thiering&#x27;s &#x27;Jesus the Man&#x27; (1992, Doubleday) uses a &#x27;pesher&#x27; method to reinterpret the Dead Sea Scrolls and gospels, concluding that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had children, divorced, and remarried. While Thiering&#x27;s primary focus is her pesher methodology rather than dynastic succession per se, the claims about marriage, children, and family do fall under the &#x27;dynastic&#x27; theme as defined by the manuscript (royal claimant whose household preserved succession).

            <div class="text-box"><div style="margin-bottom:6px">This reading does not claim pure continuation; Paul&#x27;s assemblies are hybrid institutions where civic assembly, diaspora synagogue, and voluntary association logics overlap. Diaspora synagogues themselves functioned with civic-administrative features---officers, treasurers, communal courts---making them compatible with the civic ekklesia frame. Recognizing hybridity avoids reductionism: the continuity argument concerns administrative and sociological structures, not theological content. But for the Greek-speaking cities Paul addresses, the ekklesia term and the observed behaviors map most strongly onto civic practice, supported by scholars such as Young-Ho Park, Philip Esler, and George van Kooten, who have independently argued that early Christian assemblies must be understood in the context of continuing political institutions rather than as purely novel religious formations. Papyrological evidence confirms that these assemblies were visible to Roman administration as corporate bodies.<br><small style="color:#6b7280">chapter5.tex:304</small></div></div>

          <td class="cell-snippet">
            <div class="eval-box">CONFIRMED. Van Kooten&#x27;s 2012 NTS article argues directly that the Greco-Roman political meaning of ekklesia as &#x27;civic assembly&#x27; was decisive in Paul&#x27;s adoption of the term. Van Kooten contends that Paul&#x27;s communities were positioned as alternative organizations alongside the civic assemblies of Greek cities, and that Paul&#x27;s contrast between two types of ekklesia expresses his view on two types of politeuma, grounded in the Stoic doctrine of dual citizenship. This article is a direct response to Trebilco (who argues for Septuagintal derivation) and Horsley (who argues for anti-imperial ekklesia), and it specifically supports the manuscript&#x27;s claim that early Christian assemblies must be understood in the context of continuing political institutions.</div>
